Hello Friend,
        
Here we are -- 2016! I hope your new year is off to a fantastic
start and you're fired up about electing Ted to be our next
president this year! To start off 2016, I wanted to share a note
with you that I sent to our staff just a few days ago that
highlights what we've accomplished together since launching the
campaign at Liberty University on March 23rd:
        
Financial strength:
        
            We concluded 2015 raising almost $47 million.
            Our Super PACs have been reported to be the second
best funded of the GOP field.
            We received over 690,000 donations with an average
donation of just over $67.
            
                These donors cover 66% of all zip codes in the
United States.
                Over 10,000 of our donors are "sustainers" who
committed to contribute on an automatic, monthly basis, and
provide enough recurring revenue ($500,000 a month) to fund for
our entire field operation.
            
            
        
        An unrivaled political organization:
        Emphasizing our commitment to running a national
campaign, we have announced State Leadership Teams, 1,400 strong
in membership, in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada,
Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oklahoma,
Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Mississippi, Minnesota, Florida,
Arizona, Michigan, and Washington. We've also announced State
Chairs in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, Idaho, and
California.
        In the first four primary and caucus states: Iowa, New
Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, we've built a team that is
the envy of the GOP field with county chairmen in place in all
171 counties. And after the first four states, we have
congressional district coordinators in place in each of the 163
congressional districts that comprise the 24 states that hold
their primary or caucus before March 15th. We are also actively
recruiting precinct chairmen to serve in each of these states to
mobilize supporters as it comes time to vote or caucus.
        Additionally, our leadership teams have access to over
175,000 volunteers across the nation who have signed up to help
make Ted Cruz our next president. Many of those volunteers have
already joined our Strike Force at Camp Cruz where we are housing
our volunteers in Iowa.  They are working 12 hour shifts and
exceeding their nightly call and door-knocking goals. Camp Cruz
has been such a great success we're opening a second dorm to
expand our Strike Force in Iowa, and we will be taking the Strike
Force to New Hampshire.
        We're also recruiting members of diverse coalitions to
support Ted. To date, over 29,000 Americans from all walks of
life have signed up to join our Veterans and Military,
Millennials, Teens, Liberty Leaders, African Americans, Small
Business, Faith Leaders, Pro-Life, Women, Hispanic, Home
Schoolers, Lawyers, Second Amendment, Tea Party, Sportsmen, and
Farmers coalitions.
        Coalescing Courageous Conservatives:
        Recently, Brent Bozell wrote in Breitbart to say, "Ted
Cruz is surging. He's on top in Iowa. He's gaining ground
everywhere else. He has organizations in place in every state
that matters... It's time for the movement to rally around Ted
Cruz, to make him the next president of the United States."
        And that's exactly what we're seeing happen. We have seen
conservative leaders both nationally, and in early primary and
caucus states go all in for Ted. Leaders like Brent Bozell, Shane
Vander Haart, Manny Roman, Ken Cuccinelli, Dr. James Dobson, the
National Organization for Marriage, Bob Vander Plaats, Alan
Steinberg, Richard Viguerie, Andrew McCarthy, Ann-Marie Murrell,
Troy Newman, Ginni Thomas, Rep. Steve King, Dr. Michael Brown,
Judge Paul Pressler, former Rep. Bob Barr, Gun Owners of America,
the National Federation of Republican Assemblies, Ron Robinson,
Rep. Jim Bridenstine, and so many more.
        As influential Iowa radio host Steve Deace said in his
endorsement video "I think [Ted Cruz] is our best chance to
preserve American exceptionalism for the next generation... do
not wait until the end. Ted Cruz has already put together the
resources, the resume and the organization it takes to move the
country back to liberty. Let's get on board now, let's unite now
so that we can take on Washington, D.C. tomorrow."
        What the press is saying about our campaign:
        Cruz has Trump, and the rest of the field, beat on
organization. - Politico
        Ted Cruz has assembled an impressive presidential
campaign structure in Iowa, veteran political observers here say,
with one going so far as to describe Cruz's campaign as perhaps
"the most sophisticated" the first-in-the-nation caucus state has
ever witnessed. - Cedar Rapids Gazette
        Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz is making a
big bet on building a strong organization outside of the four
early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and
Nevada. - Nashville Public Radio
        Cruz is widely regarded as the most deeply organized
candidate in the South, a region that will have outsize influence
in 2016, as many of the states vote on the same day. - Politico
        The Cruz campaign combines a traditional get-out-the-vote
operation - making phone calls and knocking on doors - with
modern data analytics to identify and mobilize supporters,
beginning with Iowa on Feb. 1. - Associated Press
        The anti-establishment angst that Cruz stokes may have
left him isolated in the Senate, but it has also fueled his
campaign on the road, where he has cultivated an almost cult-like
base that views him as a lone wolf with the courage to stand up
to Republican Party leaders they believe are no longer fighting
for them. - Bloomberg
        The months ahead:
        Some campaigns are focused solely on a man, some on a
movement. Ours is a hybrid of the two built to win. We have
brought together, and continue to build, a grassroots army of
courageous conservatives committed to electing Ted Cruz to
reignite the promise of America. Just under a month away from the
start of the caucuses and primaries we have a network in place
with the resources required to win that is the envy of every
other campaign. 
        There's still plenty of work to be done to make Ted the
Republican nominee and the next President, but as we begin 2016,
we are exactly where we want to be. Go. Fight. Win.
        This is OUR time!

32rem; min-width: 16rem;"><p><strong>Hello Friend,</strong></p>         <p style="text-align: left;">Here we are -- 2016! I hope your new year is off
to a fantastic start and you're fired up about electing Ted to be our next president <em><strong>this year</strong></em>! To start off 2016, I wanted
to share a note with you that I sent to our staff just a few days ago that highlights what we've accomplished together since launching the campaign at
Liberty University on March 23rd:</p>         <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Financial strength:</strong></p>         <ul class="ul1">          
  <li>We concluded 2015 raising&nbsp;<strong>almost $47 million</strong>.</li>             <li>Our Super PACs have been reported to be the second best
funded of the GOP field.</li>             <li class="li1">We received over&nbsp;<strong>690,000 donations</strong>&nbsp;with an&nbsp;<strong>average
donation of just over $67</strong>.             <ul class="ul2">                 <li>These donors cover&nbsp;<strong>66% of all zip
codes</strong>&nbsp;in the United States.</li>                 <li>Over&nbsp;<strong>10,000 of our donors are &quot;sustainers&quot;</strong>&nbsp;who
committed to contribute on an automatic, monthly basis, and provide enough recurring revenue (<strong>$500,000 a month</strong>) to fund for our
entire field operation.</li>             </ul></li>         </ul>         <p><strong>An unrivaled political organization:</strong></p>        
<p>Emphasizing our commitment to running a national campaign, we have announced State Leadership Teams,&nbsp;<strong>1,400 strong in
membership</strong>, in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada, Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Tennessee,
Texas, Virginia, Mississippi, Minnesota, Florida, Arizona, Michigan, and Washington. We&rsquo;ve also announced State Chairs in Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania, Wyoming, Idaho, and California.</p>         <p>In the first four primary and caucus states: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and
Nevada, we&rsquo;ve built a team that is the envy of the GOP field with <strong>county chairmen in place in all 171 counties</strong>. And after the
first four states, we have&nbsp;<strong>congressional district coordinators</strong> in place in each of the <strong>163 congressional districts that
comprise the 24 states</strong> that hold their primary or caucus before March 15<sup>th</sup>. We are also actively recruiting precinct&nbsp;chairmen
to serve in each of these states to mobilize supporters as it comes time to vote or caucus.</p>         <p>Additionally, our leadership teams have
access to <strong>over 175,000 volunteers</strong> across the nation who have signed up to help make Ted Cruz our next president. Many of those
volunteers have already joined our Strike Force at Camp Cruz where we are housing our volunteers in Iowa.&nbsp; They are working 12 hour shifts and
exceeding their nightly call and door-knocking goals. Camp Cruz has been such a great success we&rsquo;re opening a second dorm to expand our Strike
Force in Iowa, and we will be taking the Strike Force to New Hampshire.</p>         <p>We&rsquo;re also recruiting members of diverse coalitions to
support Ted. To date, <strong>over 29,000 Americans from all walks of life have signed up to join our Veterans and Military, Millennials, Teens,
Liberty Leaders, African Americans, Small Business, Faith Leaders, Pro-Life, Women, Hispanic, Home Schoolers, Lawyers, Second Amendment, Tea Party,
Sportsmen, and Farmers coalitions</strong>.</p>         <p><strong>Coalescing Courageous Conservatives:</strong></p>         <p>Recently, Brent Bozell
<a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/32640812:sOQbjzymN:m:1:1278821741:CB32FD61CD667ED9720A3CFB5802BB09:r">wrote</a> in&nbsp;<em>Breitbart</em> to
say,&nbsp;&quot;Ted Cruz is surging. He&rsquo;s on top in Iowa. He&rsquo;s gaining ground everywhere else. He has organizations in place in every
state that matters... It&rsquo;s time for the movement to rally around Ted Cruz, to make him the next president of the United States.&quot;</p>       
 <p>And that's exactly what we're seeing happen. We have seen conservative leaders both nationally, and in early primary and caucus states go all in
for Ted. Leaders like Brent Bozell, Shane Vander Haart, Manny Roman, Ken Cuccinelli, Dr. James Dobson, the National Organization for Marriage, Bob
Vander Plaats, Alan Steinberg, Richard Viguerie, Andrew McCarthy, Ann-Marie Murrell, Troy Newman, Ginni Thomas, Rep. Steve King, Dr. Michael Brown,
Judge Paul Pressler, former Rep. Bob Barr, Gun Owners of America, the National Federation of Republican Assemblies, Ron Robinson, Rep. Jim
Bridenstine, and so many more.</p>         <p>As influential Iowa radio host Steve Deace said in his endorsement video &quot;<strong>I think [Ted
Cruz] is our best chance to preserve American exceptionalism for the next generation... do not wait until the end.</strong> Ted Cruz has already put
together the resources, the resume and the organization it takes to move the country back to liberty. Let&rsquo;s get on board now, let&rsquo;s unite
now so that we can take on Washington, D.C. tomorrow.&quot;</p>         <p><strong>What the press is saying about our campaign:</strong></p>        
<p>Cruz has Trump, and the rest of the field, beat on organization. -&nbsp;<a

an impressive presidential campaign structure in Iowa, veteran political observers here say, with one going so far as to describe Cruz&rsquo;s
campaign as perhaps &quot;the most sophisticated&quot; the first-in-the-nation caucus state has ever witnessed. &ndash;&nbsp;<a
href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/32640814:sOQbjzymN:m:1:1278821741:CB32FD61CD667ED9720A3CFB5802BB09:r"><em>Cedar Rapids Gazette</em></a></p>         <p><span
style="line-height: 1.4rem;">Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz is making a big bet on building a strong organization outside of the four
early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. &ndash;&nbsp;</span><a
href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/32640815:sOQbjzymN:m:1:1278821741:CB32FD61CD667ED9720A3CFB5802BB09:r" style="line-height: 1.4rem;"><em>Nashville Public
Radio</em></a></p>         <p><span style="line-height: 1.4rem;">Cruz is widely regarded as the most deeply organized candidate in the South, a region
that will have outsize influence in 2016, as many of the states vote on the same day. -&nbsp;</span><a
href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/32640816:sOQbjzymN:m:1:1278821741:CB32FD61CD667ED9720A3CFB5802BB09:r" style="line-height: 1.4rem;"><em>Politico</em></a></p>  
      <p>The Cruz campaign combines a traditional get-out-the-vote operation &mdash; making phone calls and knocking on doors &mdash; with modern data
analytics to identify and mobilize supporters, beginning with Iowa on Feb. 1. &ndash;&nbsp;<a
href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/32640817:sOQbjzymN:m:1:1278821741:CB32FD61CD667ED9720A3CFB5802BB09:r"><em>Associated Press</em></a></p>         <p><span
style="line-height: 1.4rem;">The anti-establishment angst that Cruz stokes may have left him isolated in the Senate, but it has also fueled his
campaign on the road, where he has cultivated an almost cult-like base that views him as a lone wolf with the courage to stand up to Republican Party
leaders they believe are no longer fighting for them. -&nbsp;</span><a
href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/32640818:sOQbjzymN:m:1:1278821741:CB32FD61CD667ED9720A3CFB5802BB09:r" style="line-height: 1.4rem;"><em>Bloomberg</em></a></p> 
       <p><strong style="line-height: 1.4rem;">The months ahead:</strong></p>         <p>Some campaigns are focused solely on a man, some on a
movement. Ours is a hybrid of the two built to win. We have brought together,&nbsp;and continue to build, a grassroots army of courageous
conservatives committed to electing Ted Cruz to reignite the promise of America. Just under a month away from the start of the caucuses and primaries
we have a network in place with the resources required to win that is the envy of every other campaign.&nbsp;</p>         <p><span style="line-height:
1.4rem;">There's still plenty of work to be done to make Ted the Republican nominee and the next President, but as we begin 2016, we are exactly where
we want to be. Go. Fight. Win.</span></p>         <p><strong>This is OUR time!</strong></p>         <p><strong>Jeff Roe</strong><br />

Dear Friend,

Steve King, James Dobson, and Bob Vander Plaats joined Ted Cruz
in Iowa yesterday for the first day of the #CruzinToCaucus tour
to rally Iowans hungry for conservative change that restores
economic opportunity, citizens' God-given liberties, and
America's strength and security. For today's schedule, click
here.
                                             
                                            
                                            Leaders both in Iowa
and nationally are coalescing behind Ted Cruz, and at each of the
five stops on day one of the bus tour, the enthusiasm of families
across the state was incredibly encouraging - especially as we
launched our national homeschool coalition, already with more
than 6,670 members. Iowans are uniting behind Ted Cruz because he
is a conservative they can trust.
                                            
                                              
                                            
                                            Best,

Dear Friend,

Iowa is turning out enthusiastic crowds for Ted Cruz.  With each
stop we are more and more encouraged as Iowans unite in support
of Ted Cruz. On Monday night, over 300 people crowded into
Penny's Diner to meet Ted. That would not have been too unusual
except that it was 11:00 pm at night. People of all ages stood on
tables and chairs to get a good view and spoke with Ted about how
this is our time to reignite the promise of America.
                                            
                                            And last night, over
600 people jammed our event in Sioux Center.
                                             
                                            At every packed
event, Ted does not leave without shaking hands and connecting
with all who come out to get to know him as a tested, and
trusted, leader.

Best,

another amount) after you enter to win my free, engraved shotgun.

Dear Friend,

After three days and 13 stops, thousands of courageous
conservatives have come out to support Ted Cruz for President.
One thing is clear - Iowans are engaged and committed to electing
a conservative candidate who shares their values. Ted is a
committed conservative and he will always listen to the American
people over Washington's special interests.
                                             
                                            Follow Ted on the
trail on our newly revamped website at tedcruz.org, and if you're
in Iowa, find a #CruzinToCaucus stop near you at
tedcruz.org/iowa.
                                            
                                            Best,
                                             
                                            Rick Tyler

Dear Friend,

It has been remarkable to see hundreds of families come out to
meet Ted Cruz on our #CruzinToCaucus Iowa Bus Tour.
                                             
                                            Over and over, the
supporters on the ground come up to Ted, and they say thank you.
Thank you for fighting for my family in rural Iowa that's being
crushed under President Obama. Thank you for standing up for our
liberties - all of them, including and especially our First and
Second Amendment rights. And thank you for always standing on
principle, regardless of special interests' pressures.
                                             
                                            We are grateful for
each person who has come out to get to know Ted Cruz at every
stop - yesterday in Pocahontas, Humboldt, Webster City, and

                                            Due to the enormous
response for the State of OUR Union Town Hall Meeting, we have
changed the venue location.  Please note the new location is at
the Londonderry High School cafeteria (located at 295 Mammoth
Road, Londonderry, NH 03053).   
                                             
                                            If you have
previously RSVP'd for the town hall, your tickets are still valid
with the original address!   If you have not already RSVP'd for
the State of OUR Union Town Hall Meeting or the 2nd Amendment
Rally, please do so now! Please find the full details and the
Eventbrite links below! 
                                             
                                            Together, we will
defeat the Washington Cartel and reignite the promise of America!

Hello Friend,
        
Here we are -- 2016! I hope your new year is off to a fantastic
start and you're fired up about electing Ted to be our next
president this year! To start off 2016, I wanted to share a note
with you that I sent to our staff just a few days ago that
highlights what we've accomplished together since launching the
campaign at Liberty University on March 23rd:
        
Financial strength:
        
            We concluded 2015 raising almost $47 million.
            Our Super PACs have been reported to be the second
best funded of the GOP field.
            We received over 690,000 donations with an average
donation of just over $67.
            
                These donors cover 66% of all zip codes in the
United States.
                Over 10,000 of our donors are "sustainers" who
committed to contribute on an automatic, monthly basis, and
provide enough recurring revenue ($500,000 a month) to fund for
our entire field operation.
            
            
        
        An unrivaled political organization:
        Emphasizing our commitment to running a national
campaign, we have announced State Leadership Teams, 1,400 strong
in membership, in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada,
Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oklahoma,
Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Mississippi, Minnesota, Florida,
Arizona, Michigan, and Washington. We've also announced State
Chairs in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, Idaho, and
California.
        In the first four primary and caucus states: Iowa, New
Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, we've built a team that is
the envy of the GOP field with county chairmen in place in all
171 counties. And after the first four states, we have
congressional district coordinators in place in each of the 163
congressional districts that comprise the 24 states that hold
their primary or caucus before March 15th. We are also actively
recruiting precinct chairmen to serve in each of these states to
mobilize supporters as it comes time to vote or caucus.
        Additionally, our leadership teams have access to over
175,000 volunteers across the nation who have signed up to help
make Ted Cruz our next president. Many of those volunteers have
already joined our Strike Force at Camp Cruz where we are housing
our volunteers in Iowa.  They are working 12 hour shifts and
exceeding their nightly call and door-knocking goals. Camp Cruz
has been such a great success we're opening a second dorm to
expand our Strike Force in Iowa, and we will be taking the Strike
Force to New Hampshire.
        We're also recruiting members of diverse coalitions to
support Ted. To date, over 29,000 Americans from all walks of
life have signed up to join our Veterans and Military,
Millennials, Teens, Liberty Leaders, African Americans, Small
Business, Faith Leaders, Pro-Life, Women, Hispanic, Home
Schoolers, Lawyers, Second Amendment, Tea Party, Sportsmen, and
Farmers coalitions.
        Coalescing Courageous Conservatives:
        Recently, Brent Bozell wrote in Breitbart to say, "Ted
Cruz is surging. He's on top in Iowa. He's gaining ground
everywhere else. He has organizations in place in every state
that matters... It's time for the movement to rally around Ted
Cruz, to make him the next president of the United States."
        And that's exactly what we're seeing happen. We have seen
conservative leaders both nationally, and in early primary and
caucus states go all in for Ted. Leaders like Brent Bozell, Shane
Vander Haart, Manny Roman, Ken Cuccinelli, Dr. James Dobson, the
National Organization for Marriage, Bob Vander Plaats, Alan
Steinberg, Richard Viguerie, Andrew McCarthy, Ann-Marie Murrell,
Troy Newman, Ginni Thomas, Rep. Steve King, Dr. Michael Brown,
Judge Paul Pressler, former Rep. Bob Barr, Gun Owners of America,
the National Federation of Republican Assemblies, Ron Robinson,
Rep. Jim Bridenstine, and so many more.
        As influential Iowa radio host Steve Deace said in his
endorsement video "I think [Ted Cruz] is our best chance to
preserve American exceptionalism for the next generation... do
not wait until the end. Ted Cruz has already put together the
resources, the resume and the organization it takes to move the
country back to liberty. Let's get on board now, let's unite now
so that we can take on Washington, D.C. tomorrow."
        What the press is saying about our campaign:
        Cruz has Trump, and the rest of the field, beat on
organization. - Politico
        Ted Cruz has assembled an impressive presidential
campaign structure in Iowa, veteran political observers here say,
with one going so far as to describe Cruz's campaign as perhaps
"the most sophisticated" the first-in-the-nation caucus state has
ever witnessed. - Cedar Rapids Gazette
        Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz is making a
big bet on building a strong organization outside of the four
early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and
Nevada. - Nashville Public Radio
        Cruz is widely regarded as the most deeply organized
candidate in the South, a region that will have outsize influence
in 2016, as many of the states vote on the same day. - Politico
        The Cruz campaign combines a traditional get-out-the-vote
operation - making phone calls and knocking on doors - with
modern data analytics to identify and mobilize supporters,
beginning with Iowa on Feb. 1. - Associated Press
        The anti-establishment angst that Cruz stokes may have
left him isolated in the Senate, but it has also fueled his
campaign on the road, where he has cultivated an almost cult-like
base that views him as a lone wolf with the courage to stand up
to Republican Party leaders they believe are no longer fighting
for them. - Bloomberg
        The months ahead:
        Some campaigns are focused solely on a man, some on a
movement. Ours is a hybrid of the two built to win. We have
brought together, and continue to build, a grassroots army of
courageous conservatives committed to electing Ted Cruz to
reignite the promise of America. Just under a month away from the
start of the caucuses and primaries we have a network in place
with the resources required to win that is the envy of every
other campaign. 
        There's still plenty of work to be done to make Ted the
Republican nominee and the next President, but as we begin 2016,
we are exactly where we want to be. Go. Fight. Win.
        This is OUR time!
        Jeff Roe
        Campaign Manager
        Cruz for President
        P.S. On Monday, we kick off the #CruzinToCaucus Bus Tour
in Iowa. If you're in the area, we hope you'll join us. Click

Caucuses, and, if you'll pardon the pun, we're Cruzin'. Across the country, we have over 175,000 volunteers ready to help mobilize caucus-goers and
voters in Iowa and beyond -- <em><strong>and over 10,000 of those are in just Iowa! </strong></em>Camp Cruz, which houses volunteers from across the
country to volunteer in the Hawkeye state, is buzzing. In fact, there was so much demand, that we're renting out a second dorm to house more
volunteers. And just last night,&nbsp;<a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/32777818:sex_zZyNR:m:1:1278821741:F2D8FD668364CDCF6B582E96F233E49A:r">another poll was
released</a> reaffirming Ted's first place position in Iowa and second place position nationally.</p>         <p style="text-align: left;">And that's
only part of what's taken place this week. On Monday, the campaign kicked off the #CruzinToCaucus bus tour throughout the state of Iowa. The tour,
which spanned 28 counties in just six days wraps up this evening Waverly, IA. <strong><a

taking the jobs of lawyers, bankers, or journalists. <strong><a

Dear Friend,

After 6 days, 28 stops, and thousands of courageous conservatives
who showed up to greet Ted Cruz, the #CruzinToCaucus bus tour was
a huge success! Throughout the duration of the tour, Ted met with
Iowans in many parts of the Hawkeye State often neglected by
presidential candidates. It was a chance for many Iowa families
to hear from a principled leader who shares and fights for their
values, and it was an opportunity for them to join the building
movement in their home state.
                                             
                                            We're seeing
conservatives coalesce around Ted in Iowa and across the nation,
and we continue to work hard to earn every vote. With just a few
short weeks until the caucuses and primaries begin, hundreds of
thousands of Americans have contributed financially, signed up to
volunteer, or joined a leadership team or coalition - please help
us grow that number! Encourage your friends, family, and
neighbors to visit www.tedcruz.org and join us!

Best,

Dear Friend,

Yesterday, Louisianans rallied with Ted Cruz for a stronger,
safer, and infinitely more free America. The Cruz campaign has
built a powerful ground game not just in the first four primary
states, but in all 24 states that vote before March 15, including
the Super Tuesday states. It's another signal that conservatives
are inspired by the opportunity to coalesce behind a candidate
who speaks the truth, who does what he says, and who will be a
voice for the people. 
                                             
                                            
                                             
                                            And today, as
President Obama gives his final State of the Union address, it is
a reminder that in just a few weeks, we have the choice to vote
for a change of course -- one that would stop stifling job
creation and growth, and would instead allow for the creation of
millions of new jobs; one that would end the assault on
Americans' rights and champion citizens' God-given liberties; and
one that no longer appeases our enemies but stands up to
terrorists and defeats them. That's the kind of change that a
President Cruz will bring, and if conservatives unite, it's the
kind of change that will once again give Americans a reason to
believe in the promise of America.  
                                            
                                            
                                              
                                            
                                            Best,

             <div><div>Yesterday, Louisianans rallied with Ted Cruz for a stronger, safer, and infinitely more free America. The Cruz campaign has
built a powerful ground game not just in the first four primary states, but in all 24 states that vote before March 15, including the Super Tuesday
states. It's another signal that conservatives are inspired by the opportunity to coalesce behind a candidate who speaks the truth, who does what he
says, and who will be a voice for the people.&nbsp;</div>                                             <div>&nbsp;</div>

President Obama gives his final State of the Union address, it is a reminder that in just a few weeks, we have the choice to vote for a change of
course -- one that would stop stifling job creation and growth, and would instead allow for the creation of millions of new jobs; one that would end
the assault on Americans&rsquo; rights and champion citizens&rsquo; God-given liberties; and one that no longer appeases our enemies but stands up to
terrorists and defeats them. That&rsquo;s the kind of change that a President Cruz will bring, and if conservatives unite, it&rsquo;s the kind of
change that will once again give Americans a reason to believe in the promise of America. &nbsp;</div></div></div>

Dear Friend,


Yesterday, President Obama addressed the nation in his final
State of the Union. See Ted Cruz's response below:
                                             
                                            
                                            "The President
continues to be in denial of reality. He would have us believe
that global warming is our greatest threat, our military is as
strong as it can be, the economy is working for American
families, and that the key to alleviating poverty is more
government dependence.
                                             
                                            
                                            "The reality is very
different. We have had at least eight ISIS inspired attacks on
innocent Americans, including law enforcement, yet Obama refuses
to acknowledge the root of the cause of these attacks, radical
Islamic terrorism.... And while Obama lectured us on civility, he
neglected to pay tribute to the 10 American sailors who were
taken hostage by Iran that very day. Instead, he praised the Iran
deal and no less than three times professed the threat of climate
change.
                                             
                                            
                                            "Obama's final State
of the Union address marks the end of eight years of lost
potential for America that will fortunately soon come to a
close&hellip;. And it's a signal that Americans are ready to
stand together to elect a leader who will bring back jobs and
growth, champion every citizens' God-given liberties, and restore
our security and our leadership in the world."
                                            
                                            
                                              
                                            
                                            Best,

       <div style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;The President continues to be in denial of reality. He would have us believe that global warming is our
greatest threat, our military is as strong as it can be, the economy is working for American families, and that the key to alleviating poverty is more
government dependence.</div>                                             <div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</div>

very different. We have had at least eight ISIS inspired attacks on innocent Americans, including law enforcement, yet Obama refuses to acknowledge
the root of the cause of these attacks, radical Islamic terrorism.... And while Obama lectured us on civility, he neglected to pay tribute to the 10
American sailors who were taken hostage by Iran that very day. Instead, he praised the Iran deal and no less than three times professed the threat of
climate change.</div>                                             <div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</div>

of the Union address marks the end of eight years of lost potential for America that will fortunately soon come to a close&hellip;. And it's a signal
that Americans are ready to stand together to elect a leader who will bring back jobs and growth, champion every citizens' God-given liberties, and
restore our security and our leadership in the world.&quot;</div></div></div>

Dear Friend,

Today Ted Cruz will join 6 of his fellow Republican contenders
for the first debate of 2016. It will be another opportunity for
voters to hear from each candidate and to decide for themselves
who is best prepared to lead our nation.
                                             
                                            Just as conservatives
have rallied behind the Cruz campaign in Louisiana, New
Hampshire, and South Carolina this week, I am confident they will
continue to do so as it becomes more and more clear that Ted Cruz
does what he says, stands up to the Washington Cartel, and speaks
for the American people.

Best,
                                             
                                            Rick Tyler

Dear Friend,

At the sixth Republican debate, the central question was clear -
who can the American people count on to stand up to and defeat
the Washington Cartel. When it comes to ending illegal
immigration, securing the border, fostering job growth,
abolishing the IRS, restoring America's leadership in the world,
and defeating ISIS, Ted Cruz has proven he is a leader who will
protect and prioritize the interests of the American people.
                                             
                                            The debate stage
continues to distinguish between those who say one thing and do
another, and conservatives keep coalescing behind the candidate
who has courage to speak for working men and women across the
country.

Hello Friend,

        What a week! As you likely know, the first debate of 2016
was held on Thursday night in North Charleston. I hope you were
able to watch, but just in case you weren't, you can watch Ted's
responses to the questions asked here. Following the debate, Ted
joined a focus group of South Carolinians conducted by Frank
Luntz where Luntz asked everyone in attendance who won the debate
and if they thought Ted would beat Hillary in the November
general election. You're going to want to see how they responded!
        That was just Thursday! Earlier in the week, Ted
completed a 6 day, 28 county, barnstorming tour through Iowa
where he met with thousands of caucus-goers in the Hawkeye State.
You can get a feel for what the energy was like throughout the
#CruzinToCaucus tour here. After the Iowa tour, Ted continued on
to Louisiana, South Carolina, and New Hampshire where we are
continuing the #CruzToVictory bus tour. Find events near you
here. Additionally, we are in the process of deploying the Strike
Force we implemented to Iowa to help #CruzToVictory in South
Carolina and New Hampshire. If you are interested in being part
of our Strike Force, sign up today to deploy to South Carolina or
New Hampshire.
        We were also especially glad to announce a very special
endorsement this week. Phil Robertson, a professional hunter,
businessman, Christian minister, and reality television star on
the popular television series Duck Dynasty joined the #CruzCrew!
You'll want to watch this endorsement video:
        
        This week also saw several new TV ads from the campaign
-- one of them named "Sovereignty." It is airing in South
Carolina and tells the story of when Ted as Solicitor General
fought and won in defense of U.S. sovereignty against the United
Nations and the World Court. You can watch the ad here.
        
        We're just 16 days away from the Iowa Caucuses. And then
we will quickly take the campaign on to New Hampshire, South
Carolina, Nevada, the March 1st Super Tuesday states and beyond
to clinch the Republican nomination for Ted. We need your help
now more than ever. If you haven't yet signed up to volunteer
with the campaign, please don't wait -- sign up today. And if you
have, thank you! Please forward this email to your friends and
ask them to volunteer now!

        P.S. Ted will appear on Fox News Sunday tomorrow, so find
your local air time here, and don't forget tune in!

Dear Friend,
                                            
                                            In New Hampshire,
families are coming to meet Ted Cruz because they want the next
president to be a leader they can trust. Ted Cruz is a proven
conservative who will fight for Americans' freedom - both at home
and abroad. He's not afraid to stand up to the Washington Cartel,
and he will never back down from terrorists; he will defeat them.
                                             
                                            Ted Cruz will serve
the working men and women who are ready to restore freedom,
prosperity, and security. In 2016, we've raised more than $10
million - from 182,000 contributions with the amount averaging
$55.00 - because the people of the Granite State and across this
country are uniting behind the Cruz campaign to take back our
country.
                                            
                                             
                                            
                                            
                                            Best,

Hey Friend, This diploma is worth the same amount as a diploma
from the real Trump University. And Donald didn't even have to
deceive you into giving him thousands of dollars to get it. 
        
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            Miss us at CPAC? No
worries, Ducking Donald announced today he isn't even bothering
to show up. But we have something for you instead, your very own
personal diploma from "Trump University".
                                            And Donald didn't
even have to deceive you into giving him thousands of dollars to
get it. 
                                            
                                            
                                            Friend
                                            
                                            
                                            Donald Trump deceived
thousands of hard-working men and women looking to make better
lives for themselves. In exchange for their support, he promised
them they would win. Instead, Trump misled them and left them in
debt.
                                            
                                            Now he wants to the
same thing to the entire country. We won't stand for it. Sign the
petition to stand against Donald's money-grab and get your
personal diploma from "Trump University."
                                            Thank you,

Dear Friend,

Yesterday we had a rock-solid start to our 5 day, 10-county
#CruzToVictory tour in New Hampshire. The people of the Granite

                                            And while some

                                            Due to the unexpected
vote in the Senate regarding Syrian refugees on Wednesday, Ted
will have to briefly go to DC and return to New Hampshire in the
evening.  Unfortunately, we have to cancel our Hooksett and
Goffstown stops.  We have also moved up the start time of the
Exeter Town Hall to 8 AM. 
                                             
                                            Please join us in the
morning at the Exeter Town Hall or in the afternoon for a rally
in Hollis!  If you are able to join us, Ted would love to meet
you!

                                            For the last 9
months, supporters in the Granite State have been phone banking,
block walking, and standing behind Ted Cruz as he campaigns for a
better, brighter future for America.
                                             
                                            But what happens
Tuesday, February 9th is what really matters.
                                             
                                            It's so important
that you make your voice heard in this election. There is so much
at stake, and we must fight back to reignite the promise of
America, restore our Constitution, and bring back morning in
America.
                                            With the New
Hampshire primary less than a month away we are counting on all
of our grassroots supporters. 
                                             
                                            
                                            Please sign your name
if we can count on your vote for Ted Cruz on February 9th.

                                            Dear Friend,
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                             
                                            
                                            As Ted Cruz travels
the state of New Hampshire, and excites conservatives throughout
the state, Donald Trump continues to appear rattled by people's
commitment to voting for a consistent conservative with a record
they can trust.
                                             
                                            Donald Trump has
donated to Democrats, has supported corporate welfare and
enthusiastically supported TARP and Obama's bailouts. He's even
previously expressed his admiration for Hillary Clinton.
                                             
                                            Conservatives will
not win with a candidate who's propped up Democrats and the
Washington Cartel. We will win by painting a bold contrast
between the principles that will lead to more freedom,
prosperity, and security and those that will further the status
quo. Now is our time to coalesce behind a candidate who has
always stood for those principles, not someone who panders when
it helps him in the polls.

CRUZ FOR PRESIDENT





Friend, as of this morning, my staff informs me that you have
not yet activated your CRUZ CREW 2016 exclusive member card.





  
    


  
    


  
    
  
    *** INACTIVE -- 2016 Official Member Card Notice ***

 
    
      
  



  

  
 
    
Friend, as of this morning, my staff informs me that you have
not yet activated your CRUZ CREW 2016 exclusive Member Card.

Is everything alright? It's 2016, and the first votes are set to
be cast in Iowa in just days.


As one of my most dedicated conservative supporters, I want to
make sure you get your 2016 Early Supporter Iowa edition CRUZ
CREW Membership Card BEFORE it's too late.


I want you to be recognized for your early support of my
campaign, but you have to act now to secure your card through the
exclusive links below.


Click here to activate your 2016 Membership today >>>



There are less than two days left to get your Early Supporter
Iowa edition CRUZ CREW Membership Card -- pictured below.
  


Friend, if you activate your card BEFORE the deadline -- I'll
make sure your card reflects that you got in on the ground floor
by designating you as an Early Iowa Supporting Member of the CRUZ
CREW. 


Only cards activated before midnight on Jan. 21st will have the
2016 Early Supporter mark. 


Follow this link to activate your CRUZ CREW Membership with a
contribution of $35 or more, and I'll send you your personalized
Early Supporter Membership Card immediately.


As an Early Supporting Member, you will secure your spot on an
exclusive call with senior Cruz for President staff -- talking
strategy and laying out the groundwork being done across the
country to lock up the nomination. 

Friend, I hope you will keep this card in your wallet and carry
it with pride as your token of support for my campaign.
I'm focused on fighting and winning -- uniting the GOP to defeat
Hillary.
You see, under President Obama's watch:




  
    
         1. 
      Our enemies have grown stronger and become emboldened --
putting us at great risk both at home and abroad;
          
    
    
         2. 
      The federal government continues to expand even while the
economy grinds to a halt; and
          
    
    
         3. 
      We have lost our liberty to crippling regulations like
Obamacare.
    
  

        
You and I must band together to fight the Washington Cartel and
Obama's unprecedented expansion of the federal government
bureaucracy.

        Thank you and God bless!
        
        
  
        
        For liberty,

                                            Due to the unexpected
vote in the Senate regarding Syrian refugees on Wednesday, Ted
will have to briefly go to DC and return to New Hampshire in the
evening.  Unfortunately, we have to cancel our Hooksett and
Goffstown stops.  We have also moved up the start time of the
Exeter Town Hall to 8 AM. 
                                             
                                            Please join us in the
morning at the Exeter Town Hall or in the afternoon for a rally
in Hollis!  If you are able to join us, Ted would love to meet
you!

Dear Friend,

Today marks exactly one year until Inauguration Day. Exactly one
year until conservatives have the opportunity to welcome into the
White House a president who respects individuals' constitutional
rights, a leader who facilitates job creation and higher wages,
and a Commander in Chief who protects Americans and will utterly
defeat ISIS.
                                             
                                            If we want to restore
freedom, prosperity, and security on January 20, 2017, now is our
time to stand up, speak out, and coalesce behind a consistent
conservative.
                                             
                                            In less than two
weeks, Iowans will play a critical role in the first primary, and
we are confident that thousands of conservatives from across the
Hawkeye State will #CaucusForCruz.  
                                            
                                            
                                              
                                            
                                            Best,

CRUZ FOR PRESIDENT

over the news starting tonight and tomorrow. 





  
    





  
    


  
  
    
    
    
    
      
  






  

  
 
    
Dear Friend:

I literally have no time to explain...

But you will see it all over the news starting tonight and
tomorrow.

The Republican Establishment is running scared and has unleashed
another attack -- this is the well-coordinated and timed attack
they hope will end our campaign in Iowa and across the nation.


The longest serving Republican career politician in the nation
and his politically connected family is coordinating with
establishment politicians and super PACs to lead an 11th hour
attack against us and sink our campaign.

I am responding with everything I have, and I need you with me
this very moment.

Will you help me raise the resources to respond immediately to
these attacks?  

My campaign manager tells me we need to raise an additional
$265,000 to respond directly and forcefully to these attacks.
And as you know, we are only days away from the first votes being
cast in Iowa.

I need your immediate contribution to meet this critical need and
to ensure an all-out, forceful response -- CLICK HERE OR USE THE
BUTTON BELOW. 

    DONATE $3   
 


It comes down to this -- are we going to change America and
defeat the Washington Cartel? Or will the establishment
politicians -- from both parties -- continue to ruin America?

What you and I do today will decide this critical question.

Please do all you can by clicking here today?
-Ted

Dear Friend,

We have seen an incredible coalition of conservatives rise up and
redefine politics because of their courageous stand to take back
power from Washington. It's been a long fight, but we're not
going to give in now. Conservatives know that we must unite to
bring back constitutional government. That means electing a true
conservative leader, not a member of the establishment - and
certainly not a candidate who up until election season has
propped up the Democrats and their agenda.
                                             
                                            We have enough
negotiators in Washington, and we don't need a president who may
again find it advantageous to cut more special deals for his
friends.
                                             
                                            We need a leader who
has always stood up to Washington, defended the Constitution, and
fought for the American people.
                                            
                                            
                                              
                                            
                                            Best,

Dear Friend,

Today marks the 43rd anniversary of Roe v. Wade, and our hearts
are heavy as we remember one of the great shadows in our nation's
history. More than 56 million children have been denied the
God-given right to life. We should cherish and defend every life,
especially the most vulnerable among us.
                                             
                                            On this anniversary,
thousands of families, congregations, and students march for Life
in Washington. It is an incredible testament to the strength of
the pro-life movement, and Ted Cruz is proud to support them in
their tireless fight to protect the sanctity of every life.
                                             
                                            We need a leader in
the White House who will defund Planned Parenthood, sign
life-affirming legislation, and promote a culture of life. That
starts with electing Ted Cruz as our next President -- a leader
who has defended life at the Supreme Court and always championed
the precious gift of life.
                                             
                                            And today, as we open
our Greenville, South Carolina, Camp Cruz, it's an opportunity
for you to volunteer for Ted so that together we can stand for
life. If you are interested, please sign up here.

our nation&rsquo;s history. More than 56 million children have been denied the God-given right to life. We should cherish and defend every life,

  <div>On this anniversary, thousands of families, congregations, and students march for Life in Washington. It is an incredible testament to the
strength of the pro-life movement, and Ted Cruz is proud to support them in their tireless fight to protect the sanctity of every life.</div>

a leader who has defended life at the Supreme Court and always championed the precious gift of life.</div>

Courageous Conservatives - Reigniting the Promise of America
        
        
        
        
        Hello Friend,
        All across the country, conservatives are coalescing
behind this campaign, and just days from now, we have the chance
to do something remarkable together. We can shock the political
world with a victory for Ted in Iowa and begin the march to
winning the Republican nomination and taking back the White
House.
        Today in Iowa, Glenn Beck is joining Ted on the campaign
trail to rally conservative caucus-goers and encourage them to
#CaucusForCruz on February 1. And earlier this week, Ted was in
New Hampshire where his positive, conservative message resonated
with voters. As POLITICO wrote, Cruz "was sparking interest, and
increasingly, commitments, from voters who stem from the most
conservative wing of the party... there was also a steady flow of
people who described themselves as conservative, including on
social issues, and many said they had decided, or close to it, on
Cruz."
        Also this week, we saw a tremendous outpouring of support
from conservative leaders across the country: Gary Bauer, Steve
Strang, Mike Bickle, Congressman Ken Buck, Reverend CL Bryant,
Kentucky Tea Party and conservative leaders, and Eagle Forum
activists joined the #CruzCrew -- and we'd love to add you to the
growing list!
        There's a reason the Washington establishment is fighting
back so fiercely right now. They're afraid. Conservatives are
uniting behind this campaign because in Ted we have a
conservative leader who we all know will change the system in
Washington, break the DC Cartel, and bring power back to We the
People. All this is happening because of you. To say thanks for
everything you've done, I wanted you to be one of the first to
see our latest ad -- just completed today -- before it has aired
anywhere -- click here to watch it now.
        
        Our nation is facing great challenges, but together, we
will ensure the best days for America are still ahead of us. We
will ensure a brighter future for our children and grandchildren,
and I'm convinced that with your help we will elect Ted as our
next president to do exactly that.
        We're just days away from the Iowa Caucuses, and the
polls show this will be a close race. Everything we do between
now and February 1st will have an enormous impact, so it's all
hands on deck! If you haven't yet, please click here to volunteer
with the campaign so we can get you plugged in right away. If
you've already signed up, thank you, please forward this email to
ten friends and ask them to do the same right now.
        When Ted wins the Republican nomination, it will be
because of your hard work. Thank you for standing with us!

Dear Friend,
                                             
                                            In the countdown to
the Iowa Caucuses, Ted Cruz is coalescing courageous
conservatives across the country. On Saturday, Glenn Beck
officially endorsed the campaign and joined Ted on the trail in
Iowa. And just this morning, Texas Governor Rick Perry joined the
#CruzCrew, encouraging Iowa Republicans to #CaucusForCruz. 
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                             
                                            
                                            A week from today,
Iowans will vote for the leader they trust is the most prepared
to lead and defend this nation.  If you believe in a prosperous,
free, and secure America, this is our time to elect a tested
conservative who will not simply do what he says, but who will
defeat Hillary Clinton.
                                             
                                            Ted Cruz will lay out
a vision that rather than making us less safe and free - as the
Obama-Clinton administration has done - will propel us into a
future where our children will once again have unimaginable
opportunities and where they will be confident that America is
the safest and strongest nation in the world.
                                            
                                            
                                              
                                            
                                            Best,

                                            In the final week
leading up to the Iowa caucus, the Cruz Campaign continues to
connect with voters across the state. With more than 35 stops
throughout the week, Ted Cruz is encouraging Iowans to make this
an historic grassroots election. And today, Governor Rick Perry
is joining him on the trail to encourage Iowans to
#CaucusForCruz.
                                            
                                            The #CruzCrew is
working daily to make sure that individuals in every precinct are
ready for February 1st. Here are some stats about our ground
game:
                                            
                                                Over 12,000:
number of volunteers throughout the state
                                                836: the number
of supporters staying at "Camp Cruz" in Des Moines throughout
January (Sold Out)
                                                1,573: number of
precinct captains
                                            
                                            The commitment of our
volunteers is remarkable, and it is their continued effort that
will make next Monday a caucus day to remember.

Dear Friend,

Six days are all that separate us from the Iowa caucuses. Recent
polling suggests it's a neck and neck race, so everything we do
together in the next six days will have an enormous impact. 
                                             
                                            I wanted to share
with you a look at the organization we've put together:
                                            
                                                County chairs in
each of Iowa's 99 counties.
                                                Over 10,000
volunteers in just the state of Iowa.
                                                1,800 precinct
captains and co-captains across Iowa.
                                                247 activists and
leaders on our State Leadership Team.
                                                An average of
over 20,000 phone calls made a day.
                                                Over 2,000 doors
knocked each day.
                                                Over 800
volunteers have traveled thousands of miles to join us at Camp
Cruz.
                                                By Monday, Ted
will have completed the "Full Grassley", visiting and holding
events in all 99 of Iowa's counties. Click here to find this
week's events.
                                            
                                            This incredible
effort on the ground would not be possible without the sacrifices
made by thousands of courageous conservatives and their families
from Iowa and from around the country, so for that, we thank you!
                                             
                                            We also have a brand
new TV ad running statewide in Iowa, and you're going to want to
see it:
                                             
                                            
                                            
                                             
                                             
                                             
                                            Even if you're not in
Iowa (but especially if you are), we need your help over the next
six days. Here's what you can do right now:
                                            
                                                Sign up as to
volunteer with the campaign so our staff can get you plugged in
doing what you'd like to do to push Ted over the finish line.
                                                Download and
install our #CruzCrew app so the campaign can keep in touch with
you wherever you are.
                                                Share our latest
TV ad with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, or over email.
                                                Talk to your
friends, family, and neighbors and encourage them to visit
tedcruz.org and join the effort. Tell them that this race matters
and their support for Ted now is critical.
                                            
                                            
                                            Everyone at Team Cruz
is extremely thankful for everything you've done so far, but the
time is now to redouble our efforts to make Ted the Republican
nominee and the next President of the United States!
                                             
                                            For Liberty,

                                            National Political
Director
                                            Cruz for President
                                             
                                            P.S. I also wanted to
share the following infographic with you as a visual
representation of the incredible organization we've put together
in advance of the caucuses in the Hawkeye State! You may download

Dear Friend,
                                             
                                            In the final days
before the Iowa caucuses, our operation in the field is full
steam ahead. We have over 12,000 volunteers from the state of
Iowa alone, and over 800 volunteers from across the country have
traveled thousands of miles to join Camp Cruz in the Hawkeye
State. And those volunteers are averaging over 20,000 phone calls
and 2,000 doors knocked each day.
                                             
                                            Tomorrow is the last
debate before the first votes are cast in 2016, and yesterday
Donald Trump's campaign announced that Mr. Trump doesn't plan to
participate in the Fox News debate. In response, Ted joined Mark
Levin and Sean Hannity on the air where he issued a challenge for
a one-on-one debate with Donald, free of any moderators with
which Mr. Trump may have problems, so that all of Iowa and the
nation can assess which candidate is best prepared to be our next
President. You can encourage Donald Trump to accept the
invitation here: www.DuckingDonald.com

                                            Dear Friend,
                                             
                                            
                                            Today is the final
debate before Iowans caucus on Monday. It's an opportunity for
Iowans to hear from each candidate on the stage and to decide for
themselves who is the candidate who best represents their values.
                                             
                                            Donald Trump has said
he plans to skip the debate. That is a disservice to the people
of Iowa, and if Donald doesn't want to participate in a debate
with the chosen moderators, Ted Cruz has welcomed Donald to
debate him one-on-one, with or without a moderator, so that
voters can hear from them on their record, their beliefs, and
their promise to the people of Iowa and to people across this
country.
                                             
                                            Ducking from the
debate is not becoming of a presidential candidate. If Donald
can't stand up to his competitors on stage, how will he stand up

Dear Friend,
                                             
                                            
                                            Last night, in the
final Republican debate before the Iowa caucuses, voters had the
opportunity to distinguish between campaign conservatives who
talk a good game on the stump and a candidate who has been a
consistent, proven conservative over and over again.
                                             
                                            At the end of the
debate, Ted closed with this: "93 hours. The media noise will
soon be over - and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to
decide. Our country is in crisis. We're worried for the future of
our children and we've been burned over and over again. The
central question in this race is trust. Who do you know will kill
the terrorists, defend the Constitution, and repeal Obamacare?
Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders? Who do
you know will defend life, marriage and religious liberty?
Examine our records, pray on it, and I would be honored if you
and your family would come and caucus for us Monday night."

Ted Cruz Personal Email - May Include Privileged Communication



Friend, you're my last resort.

This is the hardest thing I've ever done. I'm emailing you again
because you're one of a trusted few.


I've got less than 36 hours to raise $126,000 or risk letting you
and all of the dedicated volunteers in Iowa down. 


The latest polling shows that Donald's attacks against me are
swaying voters, and unless we can hit this goal and give our
volunteers the resources they need -- we may not turn out enough
voters for the Iowa Caucus.



I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to quit.


DON'T GIVE UP: I can donate $5 >>

DON'T GIVE UP: I can donate $35 >>

DON'T GIVE UP: I can donate $50 >>

DON'T GIVE UP: I can donate $100 >>


If I can't count on you, one of my closest supporters, then I
could be in serious trouble...


Please don't let that happen!


I won't give up on you, and I will not give up on our country.


Will you back me?
    
    For liberty,

Courageous Conservatives - Reigniting the Promise of America
        
        
        
        
        Hello Friend,
        When we launched this campaign on March 23rd, they said
we were crazy. The Washington Establishment, the media, and the
political chattering class said it was impossible -- that Ted
could never win. But here we are. Ted is polling second in the
nation, and we're in a dead heat in the Iowa caucuses tomorrow.
        
        In advance of caucus day Monday, I want to reflect back
on what we've accomplished together. We have an organization that
is truly second to none. We've raised more money than any other
Republican in the race. We have a sophisticated data and
analytics operation that is allowing us to efficiently target
voters. We have endorsements from some of the most prominent
conservative leaders in the nation. Over 200,000 of you have
signed up to volunteer with the campaign (over 12,000 in Iowa
alone). Over 700,000 of you have contributed financially to make
this all possible.
        Poll after poll indicates this is a two person race.
We're neck and neck for the lead, and what we do between now and
tomorrow can push us over the finish line for a first place
finish. Even more astonishing is the position in which we find
ourselves just ahead of the first in the nation caucus
considering the long odds we faced at the beginning.
        Seeking the Republican nomination this year are the two
most recent winners of the Iowa caucuses. Both Mick Huckabee and
Rick Santorum find themselves in the low single digits. Scott
Walker, Rick Perry, and Bobby Jindal all have extremely
accomplished records as governors in their home states and are
some of the best retail politicians in America. They're no longer
in this race, and this week, we were proud to announce the
endorsement of Gov. Rick Perry and have him join us on the
campaign trail in Iowa.
        We have opponents in this race with incredible
fundraising networks who have unleashed attack after attack
against Ted. We've faced an assault from their well-financed
super PACs as well. The ethanol lobby -- which is highly
influential in the state of Iowa -- is coming after Ted because
he doesn't believe Washington politicians should be picking
winners and losers in the energy sector and handing out special
subsidies to one industry or another. In total, we've absorbed
over $8 million in attack ads.
        The long odds we faced from the very beginning make our
current position even more impressive. We had a mountain to climb
unlike anyone in recent political history. We're in a strong
position to reach the peak.
        Why? Because in Ted, the American people see a principled
conservative leader who will tell them the truth, and who does
what he says he will do. Now it's up to us to turn out and win!
        
        Let's shock the political world again tomorrow. If the
Cruz Crew turns out to caucus, we win. It's that simple. If
you're in Iowa and want to know how to #CaucusForCruz, our
campaign put together this instructional video -- click here to
watch it now. And if you're ready to caucus, please click here to
share it with your friends!
        I can't thank you enough for everything you've helped us
accomplish so far. Now let's go win the Iowa caucuses --
together. This is OUR time!
        To victory,

                                            Dear Friend,
                                             
                                            
                                            The countdown is
over. Today Iowans will #CaucusForCruz.
                                             
                                            As Ted finishes the
"Full Grassley" - visiting and holding town halls in all of
Iowa's 99 counties, our incredible volunteers make the final
hours count. We are confident tonight will be the first of many
primaries and caucuses to change the course of this nation. 
                                             
                                            This is an election
like no other, and now is the time for Iowa to lay a marker. Now
is the time to elect a consistent conservative who will champion
our God-given liberties; who will defend life, marriage, and
religious liberty; who will unleash the economic engine that will
create more jobs and better wages; and who will stand up to our
enemies and defeat ISIS.
                                             
                                            Tonight is a time for
choosing in Iowa, and we believe that a record number of voters
will come out to elect a leader who they can trust to stand with
the people and reignite the promise of America.

                                            Have you heard the
news?!  We just won big in Iowa!
                                             
                                            Now the entire the
world will shift their sights to New Hampshire and our campaign
here.   Brit Hume on Fox News just said that New Hampshire has a
history of not being very kind to Iowa winners.  
                                             
                                            Not with our team. 
Let's roll.  
                                             
                                            We're now a week away
from the New Hampshire primary.  Please invite all of your
friends, family, and neighbors to the events this coming week! 
Please find the schedule and RSVP links below.  And, two hours
before every town hall, please join us for a GOTV mobile phone
bank.  We'll save a seat up front for you! 
                                             
                                            Also, please join us
and the Cruz Crew in your area throughout the week as we canvass
the state.  
                                             
                                            7 days to go.  Let's
win this fight.  We will Reignite the Promise of America.

        BREAKING: WE WON!
        This is only the beginning: I still need your help >>>
        
        
          
            
        
        
          
          
             
            
              
          
        
        
        
        
        
        
          
        
          
         
            Friend,
     
    I can't thank you enough. 
     
     We won Iowa tonight, but only because YOU stood by my side.
    Heidi and I owe you a debt of gratitude.
     
    While Heidi and I are extremely excited about what this
victory means for our campaign and, more importantly, for our
nation -- this is only the beginning.
     
    Tonight, I'm on my way to New Hampshire since there isn't any
time to celebrate... 
    
    Even though it was a great victory, we are just EIGHT days
away from New Hampshire (and South Carolina is right after that).
     
    Let me be clear: we won the first round, but this campaign is
far from over. 
    
    In order to win in Iowa tonight, we had to dig deep into our
campaign accounts...all but depleting our political budget.
    
    Even worse -- we are now behind in the polls in New Hampshire
and South Carolina. If we stop for even a moment to rest, we risk
losing the momentum that we've worked so hard to build.
    That's why, before I take off for the next primary state, I'm
sitting down to write you this email and ask you if I can
personally count on your immediate support to help us win round
two (it's the only way I can compete)?
    After the hard-fought battle in Iowa, I must raise over ONE
MILLION DOLLARS in the next 24 hours or I risk wasting our Iowa
victory -- the victory you and the volunteers have worked SO HARD
to help me secure. 
    Can I count on you tonight, Friend?
    
        
        COUNT ON ME TONIGHT FOR: $5 >> 
        
        COUNT ON ME TONIGHT FOR: $35 >>
        
        
        COUNT ON ME TONIGHT FOR: $50 >>
        
        
        COUNT ON ME TONIGHT FOR: $250 >>
        
        
        COUNT ON ME TONIGHT FOR: $500 >>
        
        
        COUNT ON ME TONIGHT FOR: $2700 >>
        
        
       We are here today because of you. 
    
    After everything that the Washington Cartel threw at us and
the millions spent against us by the lobbyists, we won.
    
    Friend, this is our time.
    Will you continue your support tonight?
        
        
        For liberty,
        
        Ted Cruz

    Even worse -- we are now behind in the polls in New Hampshire and South Carolina. <strong>If we stop for even a moment to rest, we risk losing the
momentum that we've worked so hard to build.</strong><br /><br />

primary state, I'm sitting down to write you this email and ask you if I can personally count on your immediate support to help us win round two (it's
the only way I can compete)?</strong></a><br /><br />
    After the hard-fought battle in Iowa, <strong>I must raise over ONE MILLION DOLLARS in the next 24 hours or I risk wasting our Iowa
victory</strong> -- the victory you and the volunteers have worked SO HARD to help me secure. <br /><br />
    Can I count on you tonight, Friend?

Dear Friend,

Last night was a victory for the grassroots, and for the millions
of conservatives who are rising up across this country. It was a
victory for the working men and women who have shouldered the
burden of eight-plus years of big-spending Washington insiders
from both parties who have let us down. And it was a victory for
every American who believes a new day is coming.
                                             
                                            Every force in
Washington said we couldn't do it, but we have sent a resounding
message to Washington - this is our time, and "we the people" are
taking this country back.
                                             
                                            Last night was a
testament to our incredible team of volunteers in Iowa who paved
the way to a record GOP turnout in the caucus, and now, as we go
to New Hampshire and South Carolina, we will continue to coalesce
conservatives so that we can restore hope and opportunity and
prosperity to all.

Dear Friend,

On the first day after our victory in Iowa, Ted Cruz was the only
candidate to travel to New Hampshire and South Carolina where we
saw overwhelming enthusiasm from people of all walks of life.
Last evening alone, over 1,000 excited Cruz supporters rallied in
Greenville, SC gathered to show their support.

Veterans, teachers, small business owners, students, and
night-shift workers are uniting behind the Cruz Campaign because
they know firsthand the consequences of the seven lean years
under Obama, and they are ready for a president who will ignite
growth and bring back new jobs and industry. They are uniting
because they know Ted will do what he says, defend the
constitution, keep Americans safe, and restore opportunity for
our kids and grandkids.

Now, just under a week out from the New Hampshire primary, Cruz
will be traveling the state, meeting with the people of the
Granite State - shaking hands, hearing their concerns, and laying
out his optimistic vision for our change to reignite America's
promise.

Best,

Ted Cruz Personal Email - May Include Privileged Communication



Friend,
 
Less than 12 hours to go -- is your match in?
 
 The links below will be permanently DISABLED in just hours...you
won't be able to get in.
So if you haven't matched, then please stop and immediately use
the link below (if you have matched, please consider another gift
-- this is that important).
 
48 HOUR MATCH: donate $25, with the match it's worth $50 to my
campaign >>
 
Friend, I'm personally counting on you to beat this deadline.
 
Realizing how critical and HARD the next few days will be and how
important it is to continue the momentum we received from Iowa --
a few generous donors stepped up agreeing to match all online
donations made to my campaign through the links in this email.  

 
IT'S CRITICAL THAT YOU UNDERSTAND: After a clear win in Iowa,
Donald Trump and the liberal media have nothing left to lose.
They're ready to say or do anything to derail my campaign -- and
if we don't stand together, they might get away with it. We can't
let that happen.

48 HOUR MATCH: donate $50, with the match it's instantly worth
$100 to my campaign >>

Again, this special matching offer is only good for another few
hours. 

 
I'm counting on you to stand with me and show America that only
the power of the grassroots will ultimately defeat the Washington
Cartel.
 
 This is our time.

    For liberty,
    
    Ted Cruz

Less than 12 hours to go -- is your match in?
 <br /><br />
 <strong>The links below will be permanently DISABLED in just hours...you won't be able to get in.</strong><br /><br />
So if you haven't matched, <u>then please stop and immediately use the link below (if you have matched, please consider another gift -- this is that
important).</u>
 <br /><br />
<a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/33311287:WSO-PNCBN:m:1:1278821741:9902C16B3CDC9198B9A6A7F5A6BBAD4B:r"><strong>48 HOUR MATCH: donate $25, with the match it's
worth $50 to my campaign&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</strong></a><br /><br />
 
Friend, I'm personally counting on you to beat this deadline.
 <br /><br />
Realizing how critical and HARD the next few days will be and how important it is to continue the momentum we received from Iowa -- a few generous
donors stepped up agreeing to match all online donations made to my campaign through the links in this email.  
<br /><br />
 
IT'S CRITICAL THAT YOU UNDERSTAND: <strong>After a clear win in Iowa, Donald Trump and the liberal media have nothing left to lose. They're ready to
say or do anything to derail my campaign -- and if we don't stand together, they might get away with it. We can't let that happen.</strong><br /><br
/>

<a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/33311288:WSO-PNCBN:m:1:1278821741:9902C16B3CDC9198B9A6A7F5A6BBAD4B:r"><strong>48 HOUR MATCH: donate $50, with the match it's
instantly worth $100 to my campaign&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</strong></a><br /><br />

Again, this special matching offer is only good for another few hours. 
<br /><br />
 
I'm counting on you to stand with me and show America that only the power of the grassroots will ultimately defeat the Washington Cartel.
 <br /><br />
 <strong>This is our time.</strong><br /><br />

Dear Friend,

As Ted Cruz campaigns in New Hampshire, we are seeing
evangelical, liberty, and national security conservatives
coalesce around our campaign because they know that a Cruz
administration will stop Obama's extreme agenda that has worked
to undermine the people and instead lead by serving the people
and restoring their freedom.
                                             
                                            It's time we have a
president who, rather than making deals with the Washington
elites, puts the protection and prosperity of every American
first. That's what a Cruz presidency will do, and that's why
Americans across the country are uniting behind the Cruz
campaign. 
                                            
                                             
                                            
                                            
                                            Best,

                                            Friend,
                                            Over the course of
the past year, courageous conservatives throughout the Granite
State have been working tirelessly for Ted Cruz as he's been
campaigning for a better, brighter future for America.
                                            With just days
remaining before the New Hampshire Primary, we need to know we
can count on you on Election Day.
                                            
                                            Please commit and
sign your name today if we have your support on February 9th.
                                            
                                            It's so important
that you make your voice heard in this election. There is so much
at stake, and we must fight be able to reignite the promise of
America, restore our Constitution, and bring back morning in
America.
                                            
                                            Time is running out,
Friend, commit to Cruz today!

Courageous Conservatives - Reigniting the Promise of America
        
        
        
        
        Hello Friend,
        On Monday of this week, the first poll that mattered of
the 2016 cycle was held -- the Iowa Caucus. A record number of
Iowans showed up to make their voices heard, and that they did!
Ted received more votes on Monday than any other Republican
candidate in caucus history! If you haven't yet, you'll want to
hear what he said at the victory speech.
        
        In addition to a victory for Ted, Monday night was a
victory for the grassroots, for the millions of conservatives
across the country who are rising up to take our country back. It
was a victory for working men and women who have shouldered the
brunt of the over eight years of out-of-control spending by the
Washington establishment. It was a victory for every American who
believes a new day is coming for this nation. And even more than
everything else, it was victory for YOU. It's because of you we
did what almost everyone said was impossible. We took on the past
two caucus winners, the media, the Washington Establishment, the
powerful ethanol lobby, the sitting governor, and more -- and we
won! 
        Not taking a moment to rest, Ted immediately flew to New
Hampshire and South Carolina where we saw an outpouring of
enthusiasm for our campaign from people of all walks of life. In
Greenville, SC, the night after the caucus, Ted was greeted by
over 1,000 supporters! And you didn't stop there. In just the
three days following the caucus, our campaign raised over $3
million from over 182,000 contributions averaging $55.00, for a
total of $10 million raised since January first!
        Following Iowa, we have a model that we know works, and
we're going to take it across the country. As we did in Iowa, we
have opened a Camp Cruz in both New Hampshire and South Carolina
and courageous conservatives from all across the country are
sacrificing their time and talent to help Ted #CruzToVictory! If

        At last night's ABC News Republican Debate, Ted made his
closing argument to New Hampshirites before they head to the
polls on Tuesday. He made clear his commitment to turning this
country around by getting back to the Constitution and the
principles that made our country great. He also pledged to always
stand with the American people against the bipartisan corruption
of Washington -- something he has a proven record of doing his
entire life. You can watch that and more here.
        
        We shocked the nation on Monday, and that won't be the
last time we do so. Whether you're in New Hampshire, South
Carolina, or anywhere else, get ready to #ChooseCruz at the
ballot box! With your help and the help of millions of Americans
rising up across the nation, we will elect Ted as our next
president!

left;">On Monday of this week, the first poll that mattered of the 2016 cycle was held -- the Iowa Caucus. A record number of Iowans showed up to make
their voices heard, and that they did! <strong>Ted received more votes on Monday than any other Republican candidate in caucus history!</strong> If
you haven't yet, you'll want to <a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/33392346:s3p47TCNa:m:1:1278821741:BBDD3410A3CE0DBDC34A867CA5309095:r">hear what he said at the
victory speech</a>.</p>         <p style="text-align: center;"><a

addition to a victory for Ted, Monday night was a victory for the grassroots, for the millions of conservatives across the country who are rising up
to take our country back. It was a victory for working men and women who have shouldered the brunt of the over eight years of out-of-control spending
by the Washington establishment. It was a victory for every American who believes a new day is coming for this nation. And even more than everything
else, it was victory for YOU. It's because of you we did what almost everyone said was impossible.&nbsp;We took on the past two caucus winners, the
media, the Washington Establishment, the powerful ethanol lobby, the sitting governor, and more -- and we won!&nbsp;</p>         <p style="text-align:
left;">Not taking a moment to rest, Ted immediately flew to New Hampshire and South Carolina where we saw an outpouring of enthusiasm for our campaign
from people of all walks of life. In Greenville, SC, the night after the caucus, Ted was greeted by over 1,000 supporters!&nbsp;And you didn't stop
there. In just the three days following the caucus, <a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/33392347:s3p47TCNa:m:1:1278821741:BBDD3410A3CE0DBDC34A867CA5309095:r">our
campaign raised over $3 million from over 182,000 contributions averaging $55.00, for a total of $10 million raised since January first</a>!</p>      
  <p style="text-align: left;">Following Iowa, we have a model that we know works, and we're going to take it across the country. As we did in Iowa,
we have opened a Camp Cruz in both <a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/33392348:s3p47TCNa:m:1:1278821741:BBDD3410A3CE0DBDC34A867CA5309095:r">New Hampshire</a>

Friend, After more than seven years of President Obama, America
is at a crossroads. Tomorrow, New Hampshire has the chance to
vote for a proven conservative leader.

                                            After more than seven
years of President Obama, America is at a crossroads. Tomorrow,
New Hampshire has the chance to vote for a proven conservative
leader.
                                            Ted has spent his
life fighting passionately for limited government, economic
growth, and the Constitution. Now we need to fight for him!
                                            
                                            With the election
less than 24 hours away, we ask that you please commit your
support to Ted Cruz.
                                            We need to know we
can count on you on Election Day.
                                            Let's do this
together,

Friend, Today is the day! It's so important that you make your
voice heard in this election. There is so much at stake, and we
must fight together to be able to reignite the promise of
America, restore our Constitution, and bring morning back in
America.

                                            It is because of the
support of the great people of the Granite State we are poised
for a big night, but we cannot stop until the polls close.
                                            
                                            Time is running out
Friend, please click here to find your polling location, and
send this link to 5 friends to remind them to vote.
                                            
                                            I can't do this
without you.

CRUZ FOR PRESIDENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Just hours ago, Politico reported that a Super PAC -- funded
by the same characters who attacked me in Iowa -- is launching a
new negative ad campaign worth $1.5 million dollars to
misrepresent my record and mislead the voters of South Carolina.



  
    




  
    


  
  
    
        
          
      
    
    
    
    
    
    
      
    
      
     
         

BREAKING: $1.5 Million in Nasty Ads Meets Cruz in South Carolina

Friend --

I wish I had better news.

But as you can see below, this race has turned nasty again.

In the last 24 hours, Politico reported that a Super PAC --
funded by the same characters who attacked me in Iowa -- is
launching a new $1.5 million dollar negative ad campaign to
misrepresent my record and mislead the voters of South Carolina. 

These slimy Super PAC ads compare my conservative record to
BERNIE SANDERS in an attempt to fool the voters of South
Carolina.

Will you help me respond?
This is a campaign emergency -- I need your immediate help.
	

  



Friend, I wish I didn't have to ask, but I can't face this
without you. Will you make an emergency contribution to help me
respond to these negative ads?
The Washington Cartel is pulling out all the stops...literally
spending millions to defeat me.  In Iowa -- by God's grace and
with your immeasurable help -- I had the resources to respond.


Today -- I must be brutally honest -- I don't have the resources
to respond.


 FIGHT BACK » 
 

Every dollar you give today will go directly to responding to
these dishonest and misleading attacks.

I can't do it without you.

    
    
    For liberty,
    
    Ted Cruz

in South Carolina</em></font>
</center><br />
Friend --<br /><br />

I wish I had better news.
<br /><br />
But as you can see below, this race has turned nasty again.
<br /><br />
In the last 24 hours, <strong>Politico reported that a Super PAC -- funded by the same characters who attacked me in Iowa -- is launching a new $1.5
million dollar negative ad campaign</strong> to misrepresent my record and mislead the voters of South Carolina. <br />
<br />
These slimy Super PAC ads compare my conservative record to BERNIE SANDERS in an attempt to fool the voters of South Carolina.
<br /><br />

This is a campaign emergency -- I need your immediate help.

Friend, I wish I didn't have to ask, but I can't face this without you. <a

The Washington Cartel is pulling out all the stops...literally spending millions to defeat me.  In Iowa -- by God's grace and with your immeasurable

<br />
<br />
Today -- I must be brutally honest -- I don't have the resources to respond.

Dear Friend,

Big news... one of the nation's most trusted conservative leaders
and truth tellers has endorsed Ted Cruz - Dr. James Dobson.
                                             
                                            And he just recorded
a video that you need to see and share with your friends and
family explaining why. Dr. Dobson's endorsement will be featured
in an ad running in South Carolina through Saturday, but you can
view the whole video here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NldPotQNiWQ
                                             
                                            Here's just part of
what Dr. Dobson said:
                                             
                                            "The sanctity of
human life and traditional marriage are non-negotiable. Ted has
been relentless in defending the institution of the
family&hellip; 
                                             
                                            "I know Ted. He's a
Christian family man of the utmost integrity."
                                             
                                            Will you share the
news of Dr. James Dobson's support for Ted Cruz by sharing this
video on Facebook, Twitter, or by forwarding this email to your
friends?
                                             
                                            For liberty,
                                             
                                            Mark Campbell
                                            National Political
Director
                                            Cruz for President
                                             
                                            P.S. Dr. James Dobson
was exactly right when he said, "We need a president who will
defend the Constitution and nominate conservatives to the High
Court." That man is Ted Cruz. Take action today to help make him
our next president!

CRUZ FOR PRESIDENT







This won't be my typical email to you. I hope you will take a
moment to read it.



  
    





  
    


  
  
    
    
      
  






  

  
 
    

Dear Friend,

This won't be my typical email to you. I hope you will take a
moment to read it.

If you are like me, you are probably getting a little tired of
all the noise and media frenzy around this campaign. The personal
attacks and outright false claims are staggering. 
There is so much misleading information flying around on cable
TV, the internet and the so-called "mainstream" media -- it's
enough to make good people abandon this process and just turn it
off altogether.

But, Friend, despite how frustrating this process is -- it is of
critical importance. I will never give up fighting for Americans
and working to win this campaign because so much is on the line.

I hope and pray you won't give up either.

In fact, I'm so committed to winning this campaign I want to make
you a personal commitment today (and in a second I'm going to ask
you to make a commitment in return).

First, my commitment to you:



I will always be a consistent conservative -- both in word and
deed. You will never have to worry about me caving to the
Washington establishment.
I will always shoot straight with you. I will tell the truth.  I
will apologize when I make a mistake.
I will run an honorable campaign. I will discuss the difference
between candidates, but I will not engage in personal negative
attacks.  And when I'm personally attacked, I will not respond in
kind with vicious below-the-belt revenge attacks.
I will be a good steward of your support and financial investment
in me. I want you to know your support is faithfully used.
I will work as hard as I can, make personal and professional
sacrifices to win this campaign, and reignite liberty in our
nation.

I don't make these commitments lightly. They are my heartfelt
vows to you.

If you accept these commitments as my open pledge to you, then
I'm hoping you will make a commitment to me as well.

Your commitment would mean a great deal to me, as I am just  days
away from the votes being cast in South Carolina, and the stakes
are incredibly high.


YES, I COMMIT



Honestly Friend, to win this campaign, I'm going to need your
commitment because I cannot do it alone.
That's why I hope you will make the following commitment to me:


Commit to pray. In the words of our savior Jesus Christ, where
two or more gather, He is there. And while I am blessed with an
incredible prayer team, I hope I can count on your prayers as
well.

Commit to vote. No matter which state you live in, your vote will
have the power to help shape this country, and I hope you will
commit to vote for me.

Commit to support to this campaign and make an important donation
when I need it most.

Our campaign is coming up against the most brutal opposition only
days before the next primary votes are to be cast, and to
overcome it, I need the renewed commitment of each and every
supporter of my campaign -- no matter the size.


YES, I COMMIT



Friend, thank you for taking the time to read my rather lengthy
email. And thank you for considering making a commitment to my
campaign.


This is our time, and together we can reignite liberty across
America.

Heidi and I are forever grateful for you support.

For liberty,

Ted Cruz

Ted Cruz is now leading Donald Trump nationally. This is a big
deal! We're gaining momentum all over the country at just the
right time. We have a big day Saturday in South Carolina, Nevada
is on Tuesday, and more than 25 contests will be held across the
country in March. Can you donate $5 or $10 to the South Carolina
Victory Fund before midnight and help us turn out more voters?

                                            This movement is
real. We need your help to continue to bring our conservative
message coast to coast.  Chip in just $10 and help us reach

Washington Cartel dictate the outcome of this election. Tell them
you're with Ted - the one true conservative in the race.

Cruz For President
        
        
    
    
        Friend - Josie here. I'm on the ground in South
Carolina, getting out the vote for Ted Cruz. I'm emailing our
entire list because we're making history right now... 
        
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            
                                
                                Friend - Josie here.
                                I'm working as a volunteer on the
ground in South Carolina, getting out the vote for the next
President of the United States Ted Cruz. I'm emailing our entire
list because we're making history right now... 
                                Look - the media is reporting
that Saturday's primary turnout could beat 2012 by over 50,000
voters. Fifty Thousand. We need all available resources to take
advantage, so yesterday the campaign launched our Million Dollar
Victory Fund. If we raise $1,000,000 before Saturday that means
our Strike Force can reach even more conservatives. And because
of you, we are over halfway there! But to make a difference, this
help is needed immediately.
                                
                                Friend, help us make history.
                                Give $25 >>
                                
                                Give $50 >>
                                
                                Give $100 >>
                                
                                Give another amount >>
                                
                                Onward to victory,

Cruz For President

Friend,

We have less than 24 hours before South Carolina chooses. 

I am literally running out of time to close the gap on my South
Carolina VICTORY FUND's $163,143 shortfall.


With your immediate help, I can get much needed resources in the
hands of our outstanding volunteers who are already on the
ground.


So, I'm personally asking you to make a choice. Will you choose
to support me now -- with an immediate contribution -- before
voting begins in just hours?


When South Carolina votes -- I'm asking them to choose to support
me because:

I am the one candidate who will stand up to the Washington Cartel
and the D.C. establishment;

I will keep America safe from the increasing threat of North
Korea, Iran, and ISIS;

I'm the only candidate who hasn't wavered and has a detailed plan
on how we deal with illegal immigration, enforce the law, and
secure our borders; and most importantly,

I've demonstrated a consistent conservative vision to  lead our
nation in the opposite direction of Barack Obama and his failed
policies.

I hope you know me well enough by now to know that I wouldn't be
asking you for help (yet again) if it weren't vitally important.
I wouldn't ask you this personal favor -- to make an immediate
contribution -- if I wasn't willing to make sacrifices myself.

That's why today -- with only hours left before  South Carolina
votes -- I'm again asking you to choose to stand with me.

I CHOOSE TED: $5 >> 

I CHOOSE TED: $35 >>


I CHOOSE TED: $50 >>


I CHOOSE TED: $250 >>


I CHOOSE TED: $500 >>


I CHOOSE TED: $2700 >>

I'm committed to winning this campaign, but Friend, I'm going to
need your help because I cannot do it alone.


No matter the amount, Heidi and I will be forever grateful for
your support.

        
        For liberty,
        
        Ted Cruz

We have <strong><u>less than 24 hours</u></strong> before South Carolina chooses. <br /><br />

<span style="background-color:#FFF248;"><strong>I am literally running out of time to close the gap on my South Carolina VICTORY FUND's $163,143

With your immediate help, I can get much needed resources in the hands of our outstanding volunteers who are already on the ground.
<br /><br />

So, I'm personally asking you to make a choice. <strong><a

</a><br />

<strong>When South Carolina votes -- I'm asking them to choose to support me because:</strong><br /><br />
<ul>
<li style="padding-bottom:10px">I am the one candidate who will stand up to the Washington Cartel and the D.C. establishment;</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:10px">I will keep America safe from the increasing threat of North Korea, Iran, and ISIS;</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:10px">I'm the only candidate who hasn't wavered and has a detailed plan on how we deal with illegal immigration, enforce the
law, and secure our borders; and most importantly,
</li>
<li style="padding-bottom:10px">I've demonstrated a consistent conservative vision to  lead our nation in the opposite direction of Barack Obama and
his failed policies.</li></ul>

I hope you know me well enough by now to know that I wouldn't be asking you for help (yet again) if it weren't vitally important. I wouldn't ask you
this personal favor -- to make an immediate contribution -- if I wasn't willing to make sacrifices myself.<br /><br />

<strong>That's why today -- with only hours left before  South Carolina votes -- I'm again asking you to choose to stand with me.</strong><br /><br

Cruz For President






Before I board a plane for Nevada, the next nominating contest,
I'm stopping to personally reach out to you.


	
		
	
			
				
					
				
				
				  
Friend,


Before I board a plane for Nevada, the next nominating contest,
I'm stopping to personally reach out to you.

Tonight, we saw Republicans uniting around our shared
conservative message. The only message that will ultimately
defeat the Democrats this fall. 

The pundits are now calling this a three person race.

That's why, before I take off -- I need to know you are still
with me.

Friend, can I still count on you?

You see: after fighting hard in Iowa, New Hampshire, and now
South Carolina -- I've dug deep into my campaign budget.

I've just been told I must raise another $1 million dollars in
the next 48 hours in order to be able to take on the Washington
Establishment in the Nevada Caucuses and the Super Tuesday
primaries. 
I know it's a lot to ask for your help again, but I also know
it's the only way.
I am only here today because of you, and I can only compete
tomorrow if you continue with me.

Friend, this is our time.

After everything the Washington Cartel has thrown at us and the
millions spent against us by the lobbyists and my opponents, we
are just getting started on the road to winning the nomination.

Will you continue your support tonight?
Right now, I'm making you a promise, Friend.

No matter what the Washington Cartel and the liberal media throws
at me, I will always be a consistent conservative -- both in word
and deed.

You will never have to worry about me caving to the Washington
Establishment, and I will work as hard as I can to win this
campaign and reignite liberty in our nation.

If you accept this promise, then I'm hoping you will make a
commitment to me as well.

Will you commit to support my campaign? $1 million in the next 48
hours is going to be hard -- but if you chip in to help tonight
-- I know we get there.



I'M WITH YOU TED



Thank you and God bless,

I am only here today because of you, and I can only compete tomorrow if you continue with me.
<br /><br />
Friend, this is our time.
<br /><br />
After everything the Washington Cartel has thrown at us and the millions spent against us by the lobbyists and my opponents, we are just getting
started on the road to winning the nomination.
<br /><br />
<a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/33681514:sw56sCCyN:m:1:1278821741:3E395F1B3E6AA4812FACEEE3AAC18D8D:r"><strong>Will you continue your support
tonight?</strong></a><br /><br />
Right now, I'm making you a promise, Friend.
<br /><br />
No matter what the Washington Cartel and the liberal media throws at me, I will always be a consistent conservative -- both in word and deed.
<br /><br />
You will never have to worry about me caving to the Washington Establishment, and I will work as hard as I can to win this campaign and reignite
liberty in our nation.<br /><br />

<strong>If you accept this promise, then I'm hoping you will make a commitment to me as well.</strong><br /><br />

Dear Friend,
                                             
                                            
                                            We had an incredible
evening last night. Just as in Iowa and New Hampshire, we
energized and mobilized young people, conservatives, and Reagan
democrats to turn out in South Carolina.
                                             
                                            When you put Iowa,
New Hampshire, and South Carolina together, two things are
happening. Number one, it's clear there is only one strong
conservative in this race who can win. And number two, for anyone
who believes that Donald Trump is not the right candidate to take
on Hillary Clinton in November, our campaign is the only campaign
that has beaten Donald Trump and can beat Donald Trump.
                                             
                                            
                                             
                                            History has shown
that in order to win the Republican nomination, a candidate must
win one of the first three states. There are only two candidates
who have done so - Donald Trump and me. And 70% of Republicans
don't believe Donald is the right candidate to take on Hillary
Clinton in November. Now it is up to us to ensure we elect the
strongest conservative who can defeat Hillary.
                                             
                                            From the very
beginning of this campaign, our goal was to do well in the first
four primary states and then go on to compete and win in the "SEC
Primary" states on Super Tuesday. Because of you, we're
accomplishing the first half of that goal, but now we're headed
into phase two.
                                             
                                            As we take our
campaign into Nevada and Super Tuesday, we're in a great
position. We're in second place in the delegate count with a huge
number of delegates up for grabs on March 1st. Over 200,000
courageous conservatives across the nation have signed up to
volunteer with our campaign, and we are organized in all 56
states, territories, and the District of Columbia that send
delegates to the convention.
                                             
                                            I want to thank you
for everything you've done so far. We wouldn't be where we are
today without your help, but we still have a long way to go.
We're in this for the long haul, and fighting alongside We the
People, we are going to win. So this is where I need you to
double down. In particular, I need your help calling your
friends, neighbors, and supporters across the country encouraging
them to turn out to #ChooseCruz. Please sign up to get started
right away here.

other ways you can get started helping the campaign - please sign

Friend, This is unreal. You probably saw the news that President
Obama is planning on fulfilling one of his "campaign promises."
He's planning to close Guantanamo Bay. 
        
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            
                                        
                                        
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                                                 
                       Friend,
                                            
                                            This is unreal. You
probably saw the news that President Obama is planning on
fulfilling one of his "campaign promises." 
                                            
                                            He's planning to
close Guantanamo Bay. 
                                            
                                            This is truly
outrageous. Our President is willing to release terrorists and
endanger the lives of all Americans because he believes keeping
Guantanamo Bay open is "contrary to our values."
                                            
                                            He is flat out wrong.
The fact is that GITMO is an indispensable detention facility for
radical Islamists who wanted to kill us before 9/11, who tried to
kill us on 9/11, and who will go back to trying to kill us if we
release them or bring them here. 
                                            
                                            We need a president
who will keep terrorists OUT of this country. I will be that
president. 
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            Sign this petition
today and tell President Obama we don't need terrorists held in
American jails.
                                            
                                            This reckless
disregard for the safety of Americans across this great nation
cannot stand. We have to stop the president's blind pursuit of
politically correct progressive ideals that are damaging our
country. 
                                            
                                                                 
                       Tell President Obama and The Democrats
that this is unacceptable.
                                                                 
                       
                                            Friend, when I'm
President I will do what is necessary to keep the American people
safe. The detainees currently at Guantanamo Bay are dangerous and
hate this country and all that we stand for. We cannot allow them
to be released and step foot on our lands. 
                                            
                                            Stand with me. Let's
take this fight all the way to The White House. 
                                            
                                                                 
                       Sign the petition today and fight for
what's right - fight for this country. 
                                               
                                            For liberty,

planning on fulfilling one of his &ldquo;campaign promises.&rdquo; <br />                                             <br />                          
                  <span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>He&rsquo;s planning to close Guantanamo Bay. </strong></span><br />                
                            <br />                                             <em>This is truly outrageous.</em> Our President is willing to release
terrorists and endanger the lives of all Americans because he believes keeping Guantanamo Bay open is &quot;contrary to our values.&quot;<br />       
                                     <br />                                             He is flat out wrong. The fact is that GITMO is an
indispensable detention facility for radical Islamists who wanted to kill us before 9/11, who tried to kill us on 9/11, and who will go back to trying
to kill us if we release them or bring them here. <br />                                             <br />                                           
 We need a president who will <strong>keep terrorists OUT of this country.</strong> I will be that president. <br />

Cruz For President





I don't have anywhere else to turn -- so I'm turning to you.


	
		
	
			
				
					
				
				
				  
Friend,

I don't have anywhere else to turn -- so I'm turning to you.

 I need to ask you for a personal favor -- even though it may
come at great personal expense. 
With only hours before tonight's GOP debate -- and just a few
days before Super Tuesday (the most important Primary day in the
entire campaign) -- I need your help now more than ever.

I'm going to do my part tonight -- win the debate -- and show all
of America that I'm the one candidate who will defeat Donald
Trump, who will defeat Hillary Clinton, and who will reverse the
years of destruction from Obama -- restoring our country to its
founding, conservative principles.

But I really need you to do your part too...

You see: my campaign faces its biggest challenge in only a few
days on Super Tuesday, and we can win if I have the resources.

But as of this morning, I am $789,300 short of what I need for my
SUPER TUESDAY VICTORY FUND.
Will you do your part right now -- before tonight's debate -- by
making a $35, $50 or $100 special gift?
I hope you know me well enough by now to know that I wouldn't ask
if it weren't vitally important and that I wouldn't ask you this
favor if I wasn't willing to make the same deep sacrifices
myself.

Please let me briefly explain because I'm running out of time.

Running for President of the United States has been a HUGE
sacrifice with relentless attacks coming from all sides.

Only by the grace of God Almighty, the prayers of my friends and
family (my dad is a prayer warrior!), and the continued support
of people just like you have I been able to forge ahead.

Friend, it's a war I fight daily and a responsibility I don't
take lightly. 

But, if I'm being honest, I must share something with you...every
time we have a victory for the campaign or see a bump in the
polls -- the negative attacks double or even triple against us.

Between Donald Trump, the liberal media, and the Washington
Cartel, there is not one moment where two or all three are not
savagely attacking me -- and by extension of our shared
conservative values, YOU. 
But Friend, no matter how hard they try to drag my name through
the mud, I will not give in to them.

You  see: the sacrifices I'm making for our campaign are steep,
and I'm proud and even honored to be making them on your behalf.

But now, I really need you to make your own personal sacrifice
for this campaign -- click here to make a special sacrificial
donation of $35, $50, or even $10 if you can manage it. 
To make it as quick and easy as possible, I've asked my team to
put together the secure links below so you can make an instant,
secure gift to support me when I need it most:

I WILL HELP WITH $5 FOR THE SUPER TUESDAY FUND >>>
 
I WILL HELP WITH $35 FOR THE SUPER TUESDAY FUND >>>


I WILL HELP WITH $100 FOR THE SUPER TUESDAY FUND >>>

I WILL HELP WITH $250 FOR THE SUPER TUESDAY FUND >>>

I WILL HELP WITH $1000 FOR THE SUPER TUESDAY FUND >>>

Please, Friend, time is critical, and I hope to hear back from
you before tonight's debate.

Friend,
<br /><br />
I don't have anywhere else to turn -- so I'm turning to you.
<br /><br />
<strong> I need to ask you for a personal favor</strong> -- even though it may come at great personal expense. <br /><br />
With only hours before tonight's GOP debate -- and just a few days before Super Tuesday (the most important Primary day in the entire campaign) -- I
need your help now more than ever.
<br /><br />
I'm going to do my part tonight -- win the debate -- and show all of America that I'm the one candidate who will defeat Donald Trump, who will defeat
Hillary Clinton, and who will reverse the years of destruction from Obama -- restoring our country to its founding, conservative principles.
<br /><br />
But I really need you to do your part too...
<br /><br />
You see: my campaign faces its biggest challenge in only a few days on Super Tuesday, and we can win if I have the resources.

Dear Friend,
                                             
                                            Some breaking news I
wanted to share with you. Two new polls came out of Florida and
Texas today, and they've confirmed what we've known for some
time: Marco Rubio can't win -- Ted Cruz can.
                                             
                                            In Marco Rubio's home
state of Florida, Marco trails by 16 points! As the Washington
Post wrote, "this poll showing Donald Trump romping in Florida is
very, very bad news for Marco Rubio".
                                             
                                            
                                            In Texas, Ted Cruz's
home state, Ted leads by 15 points!
                                             
                                            Spread the news on
Facebook and Twitter! It's time to coalesce around a proven,
consistent conservative who can win. Ted Cruz is the only
candidate who can beat Donald Trump. Ted Cruz is the only
candidate who has beaten Donald Trump. And these new polls
confirm that. 
                                            
                                             
                                            Best,
                                             
                                            Mark Campbell

                                            The Cruz Crew Strike
Force is adapting, moving from its Camp Cruz base camps to face
the challenges of the changing campaign calendar.  Please adapt
with us.  Senator Cruz and the campaign still need your help. 
Please join us in one of the many states that will be voting
soon. You can still make a difference and share in the excitement
of volunteering with other members of the Cruz Crew and enjoy the
fellowship that so inspired over 1300 of you fellow patriots.  Go
on Facebook to read the shared stories - it has been a truly
remarkable story of this campaign.
                                             
                                            Senator Cruz needs
your help, now more than ever.  Our opponents are flooding the
airways with attacks. The best way to combat that is with a
well-organized grassroots effort.  The field has winnowed.  We
are the only conservative candidate still in the race.  We met
our goal of winning 1 of the first 4 states.  We will perform
extremely well on SEC Super Tuesday.  Now we are gearing up for
the March 15, winner-take-all states.  Senator Cruz needs you.
                                             
                                            If you are able to
cover your own travel, the Strike Force volunteer team will
attempt to place you into a local volunteer's home.  Better yet
if you can pay for your own accommodations. Join patriots from 46
of the 50 states that have already traveled to help Ted Cruz
become the only viable alternative to Donald Trump. 
                                             
                                            Will you deploy for
Ted Cruz?  Sign up here to join the Cruz Crew Mobile Strike
Force!  It does not matter if you can only volunteer for two days
or two weeks. Say yes!! Say you will deploy.  A member of our
Strike Force Cruz Crew volunteer team give you a call to sign you
up.  We'll let you know where you are most needed.  Remember, you
have a role in this fight for the future of the United States of
America.  Grab the ring!!

Dear Friend,

Much like football, the race for the Republican nomination is a
long game. Two minutes into the first quarter, Donald Trump has
the delegate lead, and Ted Cruz is in second place.
                                             
                                            The media may cover
it like it's over, but there's still a lot of time left.
                                             
                                            After Super Tuesday,
we'll have completed the first quarter, and it will be more
obvious than ever that there are only two candidates with a path
the Republican nomination -- Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.
                                             
                                            The coalition of
voters we have put together is not going to support an
establishment candidate such as Marco Rubio. He led the Gang of
Eight and the fight to pass amnesty despite telling voters he
opposed amnesty in his 2010 run for the Senate. Marco has never
stood up to own party, but Ted Cruz has repeatedly, and that is
one of the primary reasons Ted's supporters back him.
                                             
                                            With Ted, we have
something extremely rare -- a candidate who has kept every
promise he has made to voters and someone who is leading fight
after fight on all the issues important to conservatives.
                                             
                                            
                                            Americans are hungry
for a president who does exactly what he says -- not one who has
already betrayed their trust. Without Marco Rubio in the race,
Ted Cruz wins. Without Ted Cruz in the race, Donald Trump wins.
It's really as simple as that.
                                             
                                            We need your help.
Spread the word on Facebook and Twitter or simply forward this
email to tell your friends and family it is time to coalesce
around a proven conservative who can win -- it's time to coalesce
around Ted Cruz:

Cruz For President





I have never needed you more than I do today. I'm still short
$167,000...


	
		
	
			
				
					
				
				
				  
Friend,
 
I have never needed you more than I do today.
 
 I'm still short $167,000, and I face two HUGE deadlines today --
the Federal Election Commission fundraising deadline is at
midnight TONIGHT, and just hours after that, Super Tuesday votes
will be cast. 
You have done so much to help already, Friend (thank you!), but
this is the ultimate test of our 2016 Presidential Campaign, and
I am counting on your support right now. 
 
 That is why I'm asking for your IMMEDIATE response to my message
and for you to make an emergency FEC/Super Tuesday contribution
of $35, $50, $250, or more today.
 
Not only do we need the resources to turn out every vote we can
tomorrow, but also posting a strong FEC report would be a HUGE
boost for our campaign. 
 
 
If our fundraising is not as strong as we need it to be --
Washington insiders will use whatever they can against us to
ensure a true conservative has no chance to win.
 
Friend, the bottom line is this -- a grassroots campaign like
ours cannot afford any setbacks in a race this tight. So, I must
turn to you for immediate financial help at this critical moment.

I know I've asked a lot of you over the last few days...and I
didn't want to have to do this, but I must ask one more time for
your support of $35 or whatever you can afford.
There is good news: we are within striking distance of Trump in
several key Super Tuesday states -- and we lead in Texas.
 
 But we cannot afford to let up just hours short of two of the
BIGGEST deadlines for our campaign.
 I understand that money is tight and that you can't make up the
whole shortfall, but can I count on you to make a special,
EMERGENCY contribution of $50, $35, or even $5?
I need you to make sure that our hard work and the hard work of
all our dedicated volunteers is not wasted on March 1st.

        
        For liberty,
        
        Ted Cruz
        
P.S. Time is critical! I cannot overstate how important it is
that we post strong fundraising numbers! The deadline is just
hours away. So please, don't delay -- make an EMERGENCY 
contribution of $35, $50, $250, or more now.

Dear Friend,
                                             
                                            Today is the most
critical day in the Republican primary. For the first time in
decades, voters in eleven states have the chance to help nominate
a proven conservative. A conservative who has never backed down
from fighting for the American people - whether it's for our
Second Amendment right to bear arms, our religious liberty, or
for bringing back jobs, growth, and unlimited opportunity.
                                             
                                            Texas is the crown
jewel of Super Tuesday. And here in Ted Cruz's home state, the
people of Texas overwhelmingly support Ted Cruz because he has
kept their trust and stood firm on his principles against the
Washington powerbrokers.  
                                             
                                            We cannot nominate a
candidate who is a self-described dealmaker. Ted Cruz is the only
candidate who has beaten and can beat Donald Trump.
                                             
                                            If conservatives and
Republicans across the country unite, we will break the
Washington Cartel and once again put the people first.
                                            
                                             
                                            Best,

Cruz For President





Tonight was a huge win. Thank you. Now, I need you.


	
		
	
			
				
					
				
				
				  
Friend,
 
Tonight was a huge win. Thank you.
We won Texas -- the Crown Jewel of Super Tuesday, we won
Oklahoma,  Arkansas is too close to call,  and we are winning
delegates across the country.
 
The nomination is within reach -- a real one-on-one race with
Donald Trump for the heart and soul of the Republican party and
the future of America.
 
The next big election is just days away, and I need you to be all
in for my campaign.
 
Friend, will you go all in?
 
 I CAN COMMIT $35 TONIGHT >> 
I CAN COMMIT $100 TONIGHT >>
 
I CAN COMMIT $500 TONIGHT >>
 
I CAN COMMIT $1000 TONIGHT >>
 
I'M ALL IN; I CAN COMMIT $2700 TONIGHT >>
 
This is down to a two-man race, and the choice now couldn't be
any clearer: 




  Donald, a big government, New York liberal posing as a
conservative.


vs.

Me, a consistent conservative who has proven record of taking on
the Washington Cartel in every battle -- and winning.
  

 
I truly hope you'll consider this email as my most important
request and respond with the biggest donation you can afford.
 
To take on Donald Trump -- his supposed billions and his liberal
media bully-pulpit -- I need you.

 
Running for President is the hardest thing I've ever done in my
life, but despite the deep personal sacrifices I've had to make
for this campaign, I wouldn't have it any other way.
 
Every day I will fight until my last breath to protect our
families and restore our government to leadership based on
Constitutional principles.
 
Fighting alone, I can't win. But with you by my side, we will win
the nomination and the presidency.
 
I've asked a lot from you this week, and you delivered.
 
Friend, now I'm personally asking: will you double down and make
the biggest commitment you can afford?
 I CAN COMMIT $35 TONIGHT >> 
I CAN COMMIT $100 TONIGHT >>
 
I CAN COMMIT $500 TONIGHT >>
 
I CAN COMMIT $1000 TONIGHT >>
 
I'M ALL IN; I CAN COMMIT $2700 TONIGHT >>
 
We cannot afford to let up -- the future of our country is
hanging in the balance.

        
For liberty,

        Ted Cruz

Friend,
 <br /><br />
Tonight was a huge win. <strong>Thank you.</strong><br /><br />
We won Texas -- the Crown Jewel of Super Tuesday, we won Oklahoma,  Arkansas is too close to call,  and we are winning delegates across the
country.<br /><br />
 
The nomination is within reach -- a real one-on-one race with Donald Trump for the heart and soul of the Republican party and the future of America.
 <br /><br />
<strong>The next big election is just days away, and I need you to be all in for my campaign.</strong><br /><br />
 
Friend, will you go all in?

This is down to a two-man race, and the choice now couldn't be any clearer: 
<br />
<br />

<center>
  <em><strong>Donald, a big government, New York liberal posing as a conservative.</strong></em><strong><br />
<br />

vs.<br />
<br />
<em>Me, a consistent conservative who has proven record of taking on the Washington Cartel in every battle -- and winning.</em><br />
  </strong><br />
</center>
 
I truly hope you'll consider this email as my most important request and respond with the biggest donation you can afford.<br /><br />
 
<strong>To take on Donald Trump -- his supposed billions and his liberal media bully-pulpit -- I need you.<br />
</strong><br />
 
Running for President is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, but despite the deep personal sacrifices I've had to make for this campaign, I
wouldn't have it any other way.<br /><br />
 
Every day I will fight until my last breath to protect our families and restore our government to leadership based on Constitutional principles.<br
/><br />
 
Fighting alone, I can't win. But with you by my side, we will win the nomination and the presidency.<br /><br />
 
<strong>I've asked a lot from you this week, and you delivered.</strong><br /><br />
 
Friend, now I'm personally asking: <u>will you double down and make the biggest commitment you can afford?</u><br /><br />

Dear Friend,
                                             
                                            
                                            Tonight at 9 pm ET,
the remaining Republican candidates for president will take the
debate stage once again. And as the field winnows, the choice
becomes clear.
                                             
                                            Conservatives who
care about jobs, freedom, and security should unite behind our
campaign because in Ted, they have a leader they can trust and
who has always fought against the corruption and for the American
people. Or they can go with a candidate who embodies the root of
the anger at Washington - a man who has spent his life expanding
public power for private gain. Donald Trump won't stop the
Washington deals - he'll only make more.
                                             
                                            Tonight the contrast
between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump will be on display for the
nation to see: Ted Cruz has always kept his word, he's never been
afraid to stand up to the Washington cronies, and he will work
every day with a single-minded purpose - to serve the people of
this great nation so that together we restore prosperity and
bring back America's leadership in the world. 
                                            
                                             
                                            Best,

Cruz For President





Voting in Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho, and Hawaii starts in less

zip code 03223.


	
		
	
			
				
					
                    

				
				
				  Friend,

Voting in Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho, and Hawaii starts in less
than 24 hours, and as of this morning, I'm three donors short in
zip code 03223. 


Let me tell you why this is important.  From the beginning of
this campaign, we have organized a nationwide ground game...this
is the best way to win the nomination and defeat Hillary Clinton.

But I can't defeat Hillary if we are short in 03223 and others.


That's why I'm looking for just 3 donors in 03223 today...

And I need you in the next 24 hours -- before the next votes are
cast.


***Countdown To Next Primary***
Voting begins in less than 24 hours
ZIP: 03223
Status: PENDING

Three Donors Short in 03223 >>




Since Super Tuesday, we've been riding a wave of victories in
Texas, Oklahoma, Alaska, Kansas, and Maine -- along with our
first contest in the nation victory in Iowa.

Will you step up today and be a Cruz leader in your community?

Donate $5 or more to represent your neighborhood and help put me
over the top!



DONATE FROM 03223



Friend, you have been such an encouragement to Heidi and me as
we have campaigned across America.

I hope and pray you will stick with me these next few days as
voting starts. 

God willing, I will be the next President of the United States,
and our family will owe you a big THANK YOU!

Please, you can make the difference in the next 24 HOURS. 

Click here -- stand with me in zip code 03223 today >>> 
Thank you and God bless!

        
For liberty,

        Ted Cruz

Voting in Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho, and Hawaii starts in less than 24 hours, and as of this morning, I'm three donors short in zip code 03223. 
<br /><br />

Let me tell you why this is important.  From the beginning of this campaign, we have organized a nationwide ground game...this is the best way to win
the nomination and defeat Hillary Clinton.<br /><br />

But I can't defeat Hillary if we are short in 03223 and others.
<br /><br />

<strong>That's why I'm looking for just 3 donors in 03223 today...</strong><br /><br />

And I need you in the next 24 hours -- before the next votes are cast.<br /><br />

Courageous Conservatives - Reigniting the Promise of America
        
        
        
        
        Hello Friend,
        There is a simple fact in the race for the Republican
nomination for president: only two candidates -- Donald Trump and
Ted Cruz -- have a chance to go into the convention in Cleveland,
Ohio, for the Republican National Convention with the 1,237
delegates necessary to win the nomination. Following Super
Saturday last weekend, the Washington Post wrote the "results
show Rubio collapsing, Trump stoppable and Cruz gaining
momentum."
        The voters are now faced with a simple choice: who do you
want to be our Republican nominee and next President? Do you want
someone who has, like Donald Trump for decades, been part of the
problem in Washington by donating to politicians like Jimmy
Carter, Chuck Schumer, Harry Reid, John Kerry, and Hillary
Clinton to benefit him and his business dealings? Or do you want
your next president to be someone who, like Ted Cruz, has spent a
lifetime defending our Constitution and Bill of Rights?
        As a result of this simple reality, the theme that
permeated throughout the week was unity as we saw conservative
leaders across the country unite behind Ted Cruz. We were proud
to announce the endorsements of Carly Fiorina, U.S. Sen. Mike
Lee, Mark Levin, Erick Erickson, Ben Ferguson, and National
Review!
        
        The reason they are all supporting Ted is very simple: he
is the only candidate with a credible path to defeating Donald
Trump at the ballot box -- not placing all his hopes on a
contested convention -- and he has spent his entire life
defending our Constitution and Bill of Rights. The stakes of this
election are simply too high to take a chance with Donald Trump.
        Five more states head to the ballot box this Tuesday:
Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio. If you
live in one of those states, you can find information about your
polling place and commit to vote for Ted here. Then once you've
done that, please take the time to reach out to your family,
friends, and neighbors and encourage them to do the same. And if
you don't live in one of these five states, we still need your
help. Odds are you may know some people who do live in Florida,
Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, or Ohio -- please pick up the
phone and call them. Explain to them the stakes of this election
and encourage them to 1) commit to vote for Ted and 2) commit to
bringing 9 other people with them to do the same.
        If you know of any people who might need additional
convincing before Tuesday, Ted participated in a townhall with
Megyn Kelly in Raleigh, North Carolina, earlier this week, that
I'd encourage you to share with everyone you know.
        
        So to conclude this week, I want to ask you a favor.
Please reach out to everyone you know -- including those who may
be supporting other candidates. And please make the case to them
that if they truly believe that Donald Trump is not the right
person to take on Hillary Clinton in the fall, that there is only
one candidate with a shot to beat him, and that is Ted Cruz. Then
please encourage them to join our team at tedcruz.org/volunteer.
        To victory,

<em>Washington Post</em> <a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/34164116:sZv6fDCNl:m:1:1278821741:63161BD2CA66C61102B7BA55340A76F7:r">wrote</a> the &quot;results
show Rubio collapsing, Trump stoppable and Cruz gaining momentum.&quot;</p>         <p style="text-align: left;">The voters are now faced with a
simple choice: who do you want to be our Republican nominee and next President? Do you want someone who has, like Donald Trump for decades, been part
of the problem in Washington by donating to politicians like Jimmy Carter, Chuck Schumer, Harry Reid, John Kerry, and Hillary Clinton to benefit him
and his business dealings? Or do you want your next president to be someone who, like Ted Cruz, has spent a lifetime defending our Constitution and
Bill of Rights?</p>         <p style="text-align: left;">As a result of this simple reality, the theme that permeated throughout the week was unity as
we saw conservative leaders across the country unite behind Ted Cruz. We were proud to announce the endorsements of Carly Fiorina, U.S. Sen. Mike Lee,
Mark Levin, Erick Erickson, Ben Ferguson, and <em>National Review</em>!</p>         <p style="text-align: left;"><a
href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/34164117:sZv6fDCNl:m:1:1278821741:63161BD2CA66C61102B7BA55340A76F7:r" target="&lt;not set&gt;" style="line-height: 22.4px;
text-align: center;"><img src="https://www.tedcruz.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160313_OurTime.png" alt="" align="" border="0" style="width:
492px;" /></a></p>         <p style="text-align: left;">The reason they are all supporting Ted is very simple: he is the only candidate with a
credible path to defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box -- not placing all his hopes on a contested convention -- and he has spent his entire life
defending our Constitution and Bill of Rights. The stakes of this election are simply too high to take a chance with Donald Trump.</p>         <p
style="text-align: left;">Five more states head to the ballot box this Tuesday: Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio. If you live in
one of those states, <a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/34164117:sZv6fDCNl:m:1:1278821741:63161BD2CA66C61102B7BA55340A76F7:r">you can find information about
your polling place and commit to vote for Ted here</a>. Then once you've done that, please take the time to reach out to your family, friends, and
neighbors and encourage them to do the same. And if you don't live in one of these five states, we still need your help. Odds are you may know some
people who do live in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, or Ohio -- please pick up the phone and call them. Explain to them the stakes of
this election and encourage them to 1) commit to vote for Ted and 2) commit to bringing 9 other people with them to do the same.</p>         <p
style="text-align: left;">If you know of any people who might need additional convincing before Tuesday, Ted participated in a townhall with Megyn
Kelly in Raleigh, North Carolina, that I'd encourage you to <a
href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/34164118:sZv6fDCNl:m:1:1278821741:63161BD2CA66C61102B7BA55340A76F7:r">share with everyone you know</a>.</p>         <p
style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/34164118:sZv6fDCNl:m:1:1278821741:63161BD2CA66C61102B7BA55340A76F7:r" target="&lt;not set&gt;"
style="line-height: 22.4px; text-align: center;"><img src="https://www.tedcruz.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160313_V5.png" alt="" align=""
border="0" style="width: 492px;" /></a></p>         <p style="line-height: 22.4px;">So to conclude, I want to ask you a favor. Please reach out to
everyone you know -- including those who may be supporting other candidates. And please make the case to them that if they truly believe that Donald
Trump is not the right person to take on Hillary Clinton in the fall, that there is only one candidate with a shot to beat him, and that is Ted Cruz.
Then please encourage them to join our team at <a

Dear Friend,
                                            
                                            This election, a
conservative revolution is underway - one that will stop
President Obama's backwards agenda of stifling job creation and
opening borders, of raising taxes and squelching small businesses
- and if Republicans continue to unite, we can bring back hope
and opportunity to our kids and grandkids.
                                             
                                            It's clear that this
is now a two-man race, and voters have a choice between a
consistent conservative, like Ted Cruz, who will work for the
people or a candidate, like Donald Trump, who has as much
experience "making deals", supporting Democrats with tens of
thousands of dollars of contributions, and a history of holding
nearly identical policy positions as Hillary Clinton.
                                             
                                            If you are one of the
65 to 70 percent of Republicans across this country who recognize
that Donald Trump is not the best choice to go head to head with
Hillary Clinton, we ask you to join us so that together we can
get the government out of our lives so that, the American people,
the real source of prosperity, will once again flourish. And if
you're in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, or Ohio,
Ted needs your vote today!
                                            
                                             
                                            Best,
                                             
                                            Alice Stewart

				  Friend,

This election is in your hands...

It's in your power to help me unite the Republican party, beat
Donald Trump for the nomination, and defeat Hillary Clinton in
November.

A group of very generous new supporters who are determined to
unite the party have agreed to match every online donation made
to my campaign  through the links below -- dollar for dollar...

But there's a catch. 
I must prove that you and I can unite the party by securing at
least 10,000 donations, or the offer is off the table.

Unite the party matching donation >> 
So, if you don't contribute -- they won't match.

Because you have been one of my most loyal supporters -- I'm
reaching out to you first.

This could be a huge boost for my campaign -- even the difference
between winning and losing.

Will you help?

Unite the party matching donation >> 
Here's how it works: your contribution of $25 will be matched to
become $50, $50 will be worth $100, and $500 will become $1,000
-- your immediate donation will be worth double the original
amount. 

Below are special links for you to use and have your donation
doubled. Please help me reach 10,000 donations to secure the
match -- time is critical! 

Donate $10, see it matched to become $20 >> 
Donate $25, have it matched to become $50 >> 
Donate $50, see it matched to become $100 >> 
Donate $100, it will be matched to become $200 >> 
Donate $500, it will double to become $1000 >> 
I can't win these primaries without your support. 

Our victories from Maine to Alaska will be wasted if we can't
capitalize on our momentum as we compete one-on-one with Donald
Trump for the heart of the conservative movement.

Friend, with your support, we can win this. 
        
For liberty,

        Ted Cruz

<br /><br />
This election is in your hands...
<br /><br />
It's in your power to help me unite the Republican party, beat Donald Trump for the nomination, and defeat Hillary Clinton in November.
<br /><br />
A group of very generous new supporters who are determined to unite the party have agreed to match every online donation made to my campaign  through
the links below -- dollar for dollar...
<br /><br />
<strong>But there's a catch. </strong><br /><br />
I must prove that you and I can unite the party by securing at least 10,000 donations, or the offer is off the table.
<br /><br />
<strong><a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/34233653:WXFMv7CNY:m:1:1278821741:2F3284092716A8CD9210E1FF59E222EC:r">Unite the party matching
donation&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</a></strong> <br /><br />
<u>So, if you don't contribute -- they won't match.</u>
<br /><br />
Because you have been one of my most loyal supporters -- I'm reaching out to you first.
<br /><br />
This could be a huge boost for my campaign -- even the difference between winning and losing.
<br /><br />
Will you help?
<br /><br />
<strong><a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/34233653:WXFMv7CNY:m:1:1278821741:2F3284092716A8CD9210E1FF59E222EC:r">Unite the party matching
donation&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</a></strong> <br /><br />
Here's how it works: your contribution of $25 will be matched to become $50, $50 will be worth $100, and $500 will become $1,000 -- your immediate
donation will be worth double the original amount. 
<br /><br />
Below are special links for you to use and have your donation doubled. Please help me reach 10,000 donations to secure the match -- time is critical!

I can't win these primaries without your support. 
<br /><br />
Our victories from Maine to Alaska will be wasted if we can't capitalize on our momentum as we compete one-on-one with Donald Trump for the heart of
the conservative movement.
<br /><br />
Friend, with your support, we can win this. <br /><br />

Dear Friend,
                                             
                                            Today Ted Cruz is
visiting the border in Arizona, and later holding a rally with
Governor Rick Perry, Carly Fiorina, and Glenn Beck.
                                             
                                            Ted Cruz will secure
the border, and he will do so to protect families like that of
Steve Ronnebeck, who lost their son due to the lawlessness of the
Obama policies that has allowed criminal aliens to roam free in
our cities. 
                                             
                                            Ted will put the
safety of Americans first. He has a detailed immigration plan to
do just that, and unlike Donald Trump, he did not fund members of
the Gang of Eight, he fought to oppose amnesty and secure the
border. He will do the same as president.
                                            
                                            
                                             
                                            Best,

Cruz For President
http://links.emagnify.com/c/1816MAHXHzpVPHPFbG3N635d7t
Friend,

This election is in your hands...

It's in your power to help me unite the Republican party, beat Donald Trump=
 for the nomination, and defeat Hillary Clinton in November.

A group of very generous new supporters who are determined to unite the par=
ty have agreed to match every online donation made to my campaign made thro=
ugh the links below -- dollar for dollar...

But there's a catch.

I must prove that you and I can unite the party by securing at least 10,000=
 donations, or the offer is off the table.

Unite the party matching donation >>
http://links.emagnify.com/c/1816NiAKvjsKklBRibl6X1PY72

So, if you don't contribute -- they won't match.

Because you have been one of my most loyal supporters -- I'm reaching out t=
o you first.

This could be a huge boost for my campaign -- even the difference between w=
inning and losing.

Will you help?

Unite the party matching donation >>
http://links.emagnify.com/c/1816O0txj3vyOZo3oGCqO0AJ6B

Here's how it works: your contribution of $25 will be matched to become $50=
, $50 will be worth $100, and $500 will become $1,000 -- your immediate don=
ation will be worth double the original amount.

Below are special links for you to use and have your donation doubled. Plea=
se help me reach 10,000 donations to secure the match -- time is critical!

Donate $10, see it matched to become $20 >>

http://links.emagnify.com/c/1816RxTtjLJDich1Vd124Umw4q

I can't win these primaries without your support.

Our victories from Maine to Alaska will be wasted if we can't capitalize on=
 our momentum as we compete one-on-one with Donald Trump for the heart of t=
he conservative movement.

Friend, with your support, we can win this.

For liberty,
Ted Cruz

Dear Friend,
                                            
                                            From his visit to the
Arizona border with Rick Perry to rallying with Mike Lee in Utah,
Ted Cruz continued to meet with Americans who are concerned about
our safety and financial security and who want a president who
they know is committed to working for them to secure the border
and bring back jobs, growth, and better wages.
                                             
                                            Ted Cruz has and
always will fight for the working men and women who are too busy
taking care of their families to lobby Washington and who bear
the brunt of the federal government's out-of-control spending. He
will rein in the overreach and reform taxes so that Americans
from coast to coast can once again flourish.
                                             
                                            Today Ted Cruz will
address American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and
speak about his unrelenting support for Israel, our friend and
ally and a nation critical to our security - truly a beacon of
freedom in the darkest corners of the world. Our safety and
prosperity depends on our leadership in the world so that we
continue to stand against our enemies and enable our people to
freely pursue their aspirations.  
                                            
                                             
                                            Best,

Dear Friend,
                                            
                                            Today, we mourn for
all the victims of the latest terrorist attack in Brussels. As
Ted Cruz said this morning:
                                             
                                            
                                             
                                             
                                             
                                            "Today radical
Islamic terrorists targeted the men and women of Brussels as they
went to work on a spring morning. In a series of co-ordinated
attacks they murdered and maimed dozens of innocent commuters at
subway stations and travelers at the airport.
                                             
                                            "For the terrorists,
the identities of the victims were irrelevant. They -we-are all
part of an intolerable culture that they have vowed to destroy.
                                             
                                            "For years, the west
has tried to deny this enemy exists out of a combination of
political correctness and fear. We can no longer afford either.
                                             
                                            "The days of the
United States voluntarily surrendering to the enemy to show how
progressive and enlightened we can be are at an end. Our country
is at stake."
                                            
                                             
                                            Best,

                                            Dear Friend,
                                             
                                            
                                            Ted had an
outstanding election day yesterday that concluded with a
resounding victory in Utah that was personal to all of us making
phone calls from home through i360. 
                                             
                                            The Cruz Crew is now
headed to Wisconsin with a full head of steam, but we only have
two weeks to help Ted before The Badger State votes on April 5th.
                                             
                                            So will you spend an
hour between now and Sunday afternoon making phone from home
calls for Ted into Wisconsin?
                                             
                                            Ted is counting on
you to stand with him and show America that only the power of the
grassroots will ultimately defeat the Washington Cartel.

Dear Friend,
                                             
                                            
                                            Today Ted Cruz will
continue to meet with families across the state of Wisconsin.
                                             
                                            Wisconsin exemplifies
the growth and opportunity that are achievable when we get the
government out of the way and enable small businesses and
families to prosper.
                                             
                                            And as Ted Cruz said
yesterday, "What y'all did in Wisconsin is what we need to do in
Washington." That's why Ted Cruz is focused on bringing back jobs
and raising wages through solutions that get the boot of
Washington off the necks of small business owners and once again
allow them to do what they do best: create more jobs, expand
their business, and thrive in the future.
                                            
                                             
                                            Best,

<div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Wisconsin exemplifies the growth and opportunity that are achievable when we get the government out of the way and enable

what we need to do in Washington.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why Ted Cruz is focused on bringing back jobs and raising wages through solutions that get the
boot of Washington off the necks of small business owners and once again allow them to do what they do best: create more jobs, expand their business,
and thrive in the future.</div></div>                                             <div>&nbsp;</div>

Dear Friend,
                                             
                                            Today Ted Cruz is
back on the trail in Wisconsin and meeting with people who
understand what good government reform does to boost jobs and
wages.
                                             
                                            Under Governor Scott
Walker's leadership, the people of Wisconsin have seen the number
of individuals out of the work force - those who aren't even
looking for work - decrease by nearly half. Compare that to the
results of President Obama's agenda: in the same timeframe, the
number of people nationwide who are out of the workforce has
increased by 8 percent - that means even more people from coast
to coast have given up even looking for jobs.
                                             
                                            But we know how to
change course - we enact a nationwide plan similar to Governor
Walker's. We lower taxes, break up the big business union bosses,
undo the job-crushing regulations, and let the people create new
jobs and build up their communities. We know what works; we just
need a president with the will to get it done - and Ted Cruz has
proven that he'll fight every day for working men and women so
that every family can achieve the American dream.
                                            
                                             
                                            Best,

                                   <div><div>Today Ted Cruz is back on the trail in Wisconsin and meeting with people who understand what good
government reform does to boost jobs and wages.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Under Governor Scott Walker&rsquo;s leadership, the people of Wisconsin
have seen the number of individuals out of the work force &ndash; those who aren&rsquo;t looking for work &ndash; decrease by nearly half. Compare
that to the results of President Obama&rsquo;s agenda: in the same timeframe, the number of people nationwide who are out of the workforce has
increased by 8 percent &ndash; that means even more people from coast to coast have given up even looking for jobs.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>But
we know how to change course &ndash; we enact a nationwide plan similar to Governor Walker&rsquo;s. We lower taxes, break up the big business union
bosses, undo the job-crushing regulations, and let the people create new jobs and build up their communities. We know what works; we just need a
president with the will to get it done &ndash; and Ted Cruz has proven that he&rsquo;ll fight every day for working men and women so that every family
can achieve the American dream.</div></div>                                             <div>&nbsp;</div>

*** ALERT ***
        
        
        
        
        Friend,
         
        We wanted to be the very first to share some exciting
news with you: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has just endorsed
Ted Cruz for President. This is a HUGE deal.
         
        
            
                
                    
                    Join Scott Walker by making a contribution to
the Wisconsin Victory fund of $16 or more today.
                     
                
            
        
         
        Scott Walker has enacted big, bold conservative reforms
in Wisconsin. His endorsement confirms what we have been saying
for months, Conservatives are uniting behind Ted Cruz. 
         
        Will you join Scott Walker in standing with Ted Cruz
today?
         
        Over the last year we have been campaigning from coast to
coast to elect Ted Cruz as President. We have accomplished a
great deal, but there is still a lot left to do. Next week
Wisconsin votes. We must send a strong message that we are all
behind Ted Cruz. 
         
        Scott Walker's endorsement proves that Ted Cruz has what
it takes to win everywhere, including swing states like
Wisconsin. The only thing left we need is your additional
support. Please join Scott Walker and conservatives from across
America by contributing to the Wisconsin Victory fund.
         
        Your support could make the difference between victory
and defeat! 
         
        Thanks,
         
        Team Cruz

Cruz as President. We have accomplished a great deal, but there is still a lot left to do. Next week Wisconsin votes. <strong>We must send a strong
message that we are all behind Ted Cruz. </strong><br />         &nbsp;<br />         Scott Walker&rsquo;s endorsement proves that Ted Cruz has what

Dear Friend,
                                            
                                            Today Ted Cruz is
hosting a roundtable with Heidi, his mother Eleanor, Carly
Fiorina, and Wisconsin Family Action President Julaine Appling.
He will be talking to them about the issues that matter to
mothers, working women, and our children.
                                             
                                            Ted and Heidi have
two young daughters, Carolina and Catherine. They are working
tirelessly on the campaign trail each day because they care about
their future - and the future of kids across the country. Yet, in
the Obama economy, women have been hurt by the President's
job-crushing policies: the percentage of women in the work force
is now the lowest it has been in more than 25 years.
                                             
                                            Ted understands that
women like his mom, Eleanor, who was the first in her family to
go to college, had the opportunities they did because they worked
hard to achieve what others said was impossible. And he also
understands that if we want to make sure that all our daughters
and sons have that same opportunity, we need to remove the
government barriers to prosperity and make it easier -- not more
difficult -- to get a job, provide for our families, and have a
better future than their parents and grandparents.
                                            
                                             
                                            Best,

prosperity and make it easier -- not more difficult -- to get a job, provide for our families, and have a better future than their parents and

Dear Friend,
                                             
                                            
                                            Yesterday, Marquette
Law School released a new survey showing Ted Cruz with a
double-digit lead over Donald Trump in Wisconsin.
                                             
                                            Our campaign
continues to coalesce conservatives, and with Governor Scott
Walker, Carly Fiorina, and Heidi Cruz joining Ted on the trail,
our team is working daily to connect with the people of the
Badger State.
                                             
                                            Volunteers have come
from a number of states to make sure Election Day is another
victory for families who care about the future of this country -
and making sure we have better jobs, more freedom, and greater
security. We're grateful for all their work, and if we keep
working together, Tuesday will be another critical springboard to
nominating a principled leader who will fight for you.  
                                            
                                             
                                            Best,

Cruz For President





Dear Friend, this is UNREAL. I don't have anywhere else to turn
-- so I'm turning to you.


	
		
	
			
				
					
				
				
				  
                  Ted Cruz Personal Email -- May Include
Privileged Communication


Dear Friend, this is UNREAL.

"Once in a lifetime," is not a strong enough phrase to describe
the importance of this moment and the amount of pressure our
campaign is under right now.


AND I don't have anywhere else to turn -- so I'm turning to you. 


I need to ask you for a personal favor -- even though it may come
at great personal expense. 

With only hours before tonight's MIDNIGHT FEC deadline -- and
just a few days before the Wisconsin primary (perhaps the most
important primary before the RNC nominating convention) -- I need
your help now more than ever. 

I'm going to do my part -- to take on Donald Trump -- and show
all of America that I'm the one candidate who will defeat Donald
Trump, who will defeat Hillary Clinton in November, and who will
reverse the years of destruction from Obama -- restoring our
country to its founding, conservative principles. 

But I really need you to do your part too... 

You see: my campaign faces its biggest challenge in only a few
hours, and I know we can win if I have the resources. 

But as of this morning, I am $189,326 short of what I need for my
FEC deadline.

Will you do your part right now -- before tonight's deadline --
by making a $35, $50, or $100 special gift?
I hope you know me well enough by now to know that I wouldn't ask
if it weren't vitally important and that I wouldn't ask you this
favor if I wasn't willing to make the same deep sacrifices
myself.

Please let me briefly explain because I'm running out of time. 

Running for President of the United States has come at a steep
price with relentless attacks coming from all sides on my family,
my marriage, and worst of all, attacks against my young children.

It is only by the grace of God, the prayers of my friends and
family -- my dad is a prayer warrior -- and the continued support
of people just like you have I been able to endure such deep
personal sacrifices.

Friend, this battle I fight daily is a responsibility not to be
taken lightly. 

But, if I'm being honest, I must share something with you...

Every single time we have a victory for the campaign or that we
see a bump in the polls -- the negative attacks double and triple
against us. 

Between Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, the liberal media, and the
Washington Cartel, there is not one moment where they are not
savagely attacking me. And Friend, by extension of our shared
conservative values, they're attacking YOU too. 

Rest assured -- no matter how hard they try to drag my name
through the mud, I will not give in to them. 

But now, I really need you to make your own personal sacrifice
for this campaign -- click here to make a special sacrificial
donation of $35, $50, or even $10 if you can afford it.

You see: the sacrifices I'm making for our campaign are deep and
personal. I'm proud and even honored to be making them on your
behalf, but today, before the most important deadline that we
face at MIDNIGHT, I need to hear back from you personally.


To make it as quick and easy as possible for you to respond, I've
asked my team to put together the secure links below.

You can use them to make an instant, secure gift to support me
when I need it most: 

I WILL HELP WITH $3 BEFORE MIDNIGHT >>>

I WILL HELP WITH $35 BEFORE MIDNIGHT >>> 

I WILL HELP WITH $100 BEFORE MIDNIGHT >>> 

I WILL HELP WITH $250 BEFORE MIDNIGHT >>> 

I WILL HELP WITH $1000 BEFORE MIDNIGHT >>> 
Please, time is critical. 

Friend, I hope to hear back from you before tonight's deadline
passes. 

        
        For liberty,
        
        Ted Cruz

Cruz For President





Friend, we're very close. But that's not enough in light of
what's going on...People are getting hurt, charges are being
filed, and no responsibility is being taken.


	
		
	
			
				
					
                 

				
				
				  Friend, we're very close. 

But that's not enough in light of what's going on...can you send
help??

Here's the situation. 

FIRST: The Washington Post attacked my children in a despicable
cartoon that compared them to trained monkeys.
NEXT: Donald Trump attacked Heidi personally and then
doubled-down on his playground antics. 

NOW: A concerning culture is running rampant through the Trump
campaign. People are getting hurt, charges are being filed, and
no responsibility is being taken. 

Friend, this must stop, but I can't do it alone -- I need you by
my side to end these attacks and stop this nonsense. 

There are less than 6 hours left before my biggest campaign
deadline is here. Will you send immediate help before it gets
here? 


If you step up in the next few hours, I will have the resources
to fight these attacks, win the nomination, and defeat Hillary
Clinton.

But without your help -- Donald Trump will win -- and his
campaign culture of attacks, insults, and violence will continue
to dominate.




 I'm with you Ted: $3 » 


 I'm with you Ted: $35 » 

 I'm with you Ted: $50 » 

 I'm with you Ted: $100 » 

 I'm with you Ted: $250 » 



Thank you, Friend.
        
For liberty,

Dear Friend,
                                            
                                            In Wisconsin, we are
seeing young people, families, and working Americans rallying
behind Ted Cruz. They know this election is an opportunity to
change the course of our country - to get back to a booming
economy where we are able to plan for the future.
                                             
                                            Just four days out
from the Wisconsin primary, the people of the Badger State are
joining Governor Scott Walker to elect a candidate who has real
solutions focused on lifting all Americans out from a stifled
economy. Ted Cruz will rein in government and dramatically reform
the tax code so we can unleash the engine of economic growth that
has made this nation a landscape of opportunity.
                                            
                                             
                                            Best,

r /><br />An overwhelming victory in Wisconsin and other pivotal states has=
 turned national attention to our conservative, optimistic message. This is=
 the defining moment in the campaign and support is turning our way. While =
other campaigns have real concerns about their viability going forward, we =
are setting fundraising records and winning states. It is an understatement=
 to say that our competitors and the Washington Cartel are worried. <strong=
>They are very worried.</strong><br /><br />In the past year we have built =
our campaign for this very moment. While our competitors were focused on sh=
iny objects and flashy campaign slogans, we were busy building a robust gra=
ssroots operation. We have team members in districts across the country. We=
 have a voter data operation that is unparalleled. And a grassroots support=
 network that has been powered by people just like you.<br /><br />Our win =
in Wisconsin changed the race. We were not supposed to win there, but we di=
d so resoundingly. We are ready to now capitalize on it. But we could use y=
our additional support to help us get to the next level.<br /><br /><a href=

        ***Politico BREAKING NEWS: Trump to give campaign over
$20 Million*** 
        
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            
                                 ***Politico BREAKING NEWS: Trump
to give campaign over $20 Million***
                                
                                  
                            
                            
                                 Friend,
                                
                                You may have heard -- Donald
Trump won New York last night.  
                                
                                As I write you, Politico is
breaking the news that Donald Trump has just committed $20
Million dollars to his campaign -- a move calculated to crush my
campaign and wrestle the nomination away from Conservative
Americans. 
                                
                                You also have probably heard that
Hillary has also already raised well over $100 million for her
campaign.  
                                
                                Both Trump and Clinton are used
to throwing money around and using it to get whatever they want. 

                                
                                Friend, I'm now in the middle of
a big-money firestorm, with Hillary Clinton on one side and
Donald Trump on the other. 
                                
                                I'm quite literally fighting for
my political life, and your response to this email will determine
the success of this campaign and ultimately the direction of our
country for years to come.
                                
                                So, I'm personally asking you one
more time: will you help me unite the GOP and take on Donald
Trump and his friend Hillary Clinton? Will you make an urgent
gift to help me compete with Donald Trump's billions?
                                
                                I know I have asked a lot of you
in the course of this campaign, but if I can't count on you now,
it will be over.  
                                
                                With delegates being selected
almost daily and Donald Trump tapping into his billion dollar
slush fund to take his attacks against me to a level previously
unheard of -- I have to ask again: Will you make an urgent
contribution to my campaign to defeat Donald Trump?
                                
                                There are still 15 primary
contests left before the convention and hundreds of delegates to
be won. If I don't have the resources to compete, you and I will
have lost the greatest opportunity to change the direction of
this county, and Donald Trump will surely lose to Hillary
Clinton. 
                                
                                Friend, it is that important. 
                                
                                So, I've asked my team to put
together special Defeat Donald Trump links below. It will take
you only a moment to make a donation, and you could help change
the direction of our nation.

last night.  <br />                                 <br />                                 As I write you, <strong>Politico is breaking the news that
Donald Trump has just committed $20 Million dollars to his campaign</strong> -- a move calculated to crush my campaign and wrestle the nomination away
from Conservative Americans. <br />                                 <br />                                 You also have probably heard that Hillary
has also already raised well over $100 million for her campaign.  <br />                                 <br />                                 Both
Trump and Clinton are used to throwing money around and using it to get whatever they want.  <br />                                 <br />            
                    Friend, I'm now in the middle of a big-money firestorm, with Hillary Clinton on one side and Donald Trump on the other. <br />   
                             <br />                                 <strong>I'm quite literally fighting for my political life, and your response to
this email will determine the success of this campaign and ultimately the direction of our country for years to come.</strong><br />                  
              <br />                                 So, I'm personally asking you one more time: will you help me unite the GOP and take on Donald
Trump and his friend Hillary Clinton? <strong><a href="http://email.hspdirect.com/ct/34913006:sDmHF4CNI:m:1:1300916946:248B276E41E3333CA44E23155D8E7E4E:r">Will you make an urgent

I have asked a lot of you in the course of this campaign, but if I can't count on you now, it will be over.  <br />                                
<br />                                 With delegates being selected almost daily and Donald Trump tapping into his billion dollar slush fund to take
his attacks against me to a level previously unheard of -- <strong>I have to ask again: <a

convention and hundreds of delegates to be won. <u>If I don't have the resources to compete, you and I will have lost the greatest opportunity to
change the direction of this county, and Donald Trump will surely lose to Hillary Clinton.</u> <br />                                 <br />

Trump Says Being From New York Drives His Views on Gay Marriage,
Partial-Birth Abortion 

Dear Friend,

There has been a lot written since the last debate in South
Carolina about "New York Values". The national media that is
mostly based out of New York pretends they don't understand what
New York Values are. Liberal New York politicians pretend to be
outraged. But everyone knows what this is about. It's about
electing a president who shares our conservative values.
                                            
That's why Donald Trump has done everything possible to change
the subject because he doesn't want you to know about the Real
Donald Trump. Before he was a presidential candidate, the Real
Donald Trump talked about New York Values in his own words and
how they shaped his views on gay marriage and life. In fact, he
admitted then that if he were president he would not even ban
partial-birth abortions. 

Watch this NBC News video with the late Tim Russert where the
Real Donald Trump discusses how his views were shaped by growing
up in New York City. He says that New York "views" and
"attitudes" are different than other places in the country, such
as Iowa. We agree with the Real Donald Trump:

As Donald Trump admits, his New York values are different from
the values of most of America. After watching the video yourself,
please share it with your family, friends and neighbors so they
can see this for themselves.

Also, check out this Yahoo News story that explains why the Real
Donald Trump does not want you to see the video. Share that too.

In 2016, we have a chance to elect a Real Conservative who shares
our values. That's Ted Cruz.

Thank you for all you do.
