John - Thank you for joining the movement to take our country
back. 

I'm running for President of the United States of America because
I want to defeat the Washington machine. 

Our country is run by and for the special interests, and the
career politicians in both parties let it happen. 

We look around and see the same old, tired career politicians
from yester year running. Hillary Clinton? We know how that movie
ends... trillions more in debt, more taxes, and more Benghazis.
Radical Islam thrived and grew while Hillary was on the top floor
of the state department. Now she wants a promotion? 

The elites that run the Washington machine at our expense will
throw everything against us. 

That's why we need your help today, right now, to help fuel our
campaign to defeat the Washington machine. 

Will you contribute $25, $50, $100, $250, $1,000, or even the
maximum $2,700? 

No amount is too small. The biggest thing we need is you on board
today. 

Here's the thing: we're in this race. That means the media,
pundits, and the elites will want to know how many people got on
board. 

Our first quarter's fundraising total very well be the most
important of the entire campaign because it will set the tone. 

You see, the experts say a dollar contributed early on is worth
$2 or $3 later. That's been one of the tricks of the power
brokers. Hillary will raise gobs of cash out of DC, New York, San
Francisco, and LA. 

So we need early support. It's crucial. 

And with your support here's my plan to defeat the Washington
machine and unleash the American Dream: 
Term limits to get rid of the career politicians.
Require Congress to read legislation before they actually vote on
it - read the bills!
Audit the Fed - we deserve to know what's happening with our
money.
Pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution - no more
adding trillions in debt - time to pay it down.
Boldly overhaul the tax code - no more loopholes for the biggest
corporations with the best lobbyists - give workers a tax cut.
Stop Common Core - school choice is the way forward.
And on and on and on.
Basically it's the opposite of what Hillary would do. Term
limits, read the bills, Audit the Fed, cut debt, overhaul the tax
code, ending Common Core... 

... and I'll take this message to every corner of America. I've
been to Detroit. I've been to Ferguson. I've been to Berkeley.
I've been to Chicago. I've been to Howard. Everywhere I go I
bring the conservative message to the young, to those who are
struggling, to those who the Left has failed... and they respond!


Ours is the winning message, but it is one that scares those who
have profited at our expense. 

So I'm running for President of the United States. 

I humbly ask you to help us defeat the Washington machine. 

Today - right now - is when I need your help most. 

Thank you. 

Rand Paul

John,
                    
                    Today begins Week 3 of my Phone for Liberty
Challenge. As you know, I've challenged Congressman Amash to lead
a team of dedicated supporters who will compete to make the most
phone calls for my campaign and win awesome prizes.
                     
                    I'm happy to tell you that your team has
continued to put up impressive numbers and is moving on to Week
3! But Congressmen Amash needs your help now more than ever to
propel your team to victory.
                     
                    
                    
                    Will you sign-up for his team and begin
calling today?
                     
                    It's crucial that we reach as many early
state voters as possible in the remaining weeks to the first
elections, so I'm counting on you to make a difference and lead
your team to victory.
                     
                    Sign up HERE!

John,
                    Rand Paul is returning to the Granite State
next week for another grassroots swing riding a wave of momentum!
Showing his grassroots strength, Rand recently released his 500th
leadership team member endorsement in New Hampshire and his
1000th precinct captain in Iowa. I hope you'll come out and see
the excitement and momentum building around this campaign.

John,
                    Did you see Mike's email?
                    Let's meet up while I'm in New Hampshire this
weekend.

                    John,
                    Rand Paul is returning to the Granite State
next week for another grassroots swing riding a wave of momentum!
Showing his grassroots strength, Rand recently released his 500th
leadership team member endorsement in New Hampshire and his
1000th precinct captain in Iowa. I hope you'll come out and see
the excitement and momentum building around this campaign.

John,
                    We just came off a successful trip across New
Hampshire this weekend, where we had overflowing crowds
everywhere Rand went. Check out the spectacular crowd that turned
out for Rand's Town Hall in Hollis Friday night. 
                    
                    Rand Paul is returning to the Granite State
this weekend for another grassroots swing. With just 22 days
until the New Hampshire primary, it's critical that we continue
to capitalize on Rand's momentum and show everyone that we are
poised for success in New Hampshire.
                    I hope you'll join us at an event this
weekend.

John,
                    I'm excited to announce that my wife Kelley
and youngest son Robert will be joining me on the campaign trail
in New Hampshire today and tomorrow.

you'll join us along the way.
                    Rand

John,
                    They tried to silence us and failed.  The
people have spoken and Thursday night, the American people will
again hear the defender of liberty.  Rand Paul coming back to the
debate stage this Thursday at 9:00PM on Fox News.
                    
                    Join your fellow supporters to cheer on Rand
at our Manchester Headquarters and Littleton Campaign Office.  We
also need your help before the debate to call undecided voters to
ask for their vote and remind them to watch the debate.  We only
have two weeks left until Election Day and your help is vital to
ensure as many New Hampshire voters as possible hear Rand's
message of freedom and liberty.

John,
                    We are excitedly preparing for Rand's final
swing through New Hampshire and wanted to give you the first look
at the schedule. All eyes are now on New Hampshire, so let's
capitalize on this momentum and show everyone that we are poised
for success here in the Granite State.
                    I hope you'll join us at the Town Halls
