Dear Friend,

Thank you for joining our campaign for president! A national campaign is a =
serious undertaking, and it will take nothing less than a political =
revolution to reclaim our democracy.

The people of New Hampshire are crucial to this effort. We must stand =
together and say, "Enough is enough. This country and our government =
belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires."

We'd like to send you a free car magnet to welcome you to the campaign. =
Tell us where to send it:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/nh-free-magnet?source=3DemHL

The middle class in America is at a tipping point, and it will not last =
another generation if we don't boldly change course now. People are =
working longer hours for lower wages. They are worrying about whether =
their kids will be able to afford college or get decent jobs, and =
questioning whether they will have enough savings to retire with dignity.

This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It is about a grassroots =
movement which engages Americans in every community across the country. We =
need to face up to the reality of where we are as a nation, and we need a =
mass movement of people to fight for change.

Welcome to the political revolution. Let us know where to send your free =
car magnet:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/nh-free-magnet?source=3DemHL

Thank you for your support,

Team Bernie

Sisters and Brothers --

Greed, fraud, dishonesty, and arrogance: these are the words that best =
describe the reality of Wall Street today.

We can no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that have been =
rigged by Wall Street to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country =
at the expense of everyone else. While President Obama deserves credit for =
getting this economy back on track after the Wall Street crash, the =
reality is there is a lot of unfinished business.

That's why today in New York City, I announced my plan for taking on Wall =
Street. We must break up the banks, end their casino-style gambling, and =
fundamentally change the approach of the financial industry to focus on =
helping the American people.

When I am president, we will reform Wall Street and our financial system =
to make it work for all Americans. I want to tell you about what I will =
do, then ask you to add your name to endorse our plan:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/wall-street

To those on Wall Street, let me be very clear. Greed is not good. In fact, =
the greed of Wall Street and corporate America is destroying the fabric of =
our nation. And here is a promise I will make as president: If Wall Street =
does not end its greed, we will end it for them.

As most people know, in the 1990s and later, financial interests spent =
billions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to force =
through Congress the deregulation of Wall Street, the repeal of the =
Glass-Steagall Act, and the weakening of consumer protection laws.

They paid this money to show the American people all that they could do =
with that freedom. Well, they sure showed the American people. In 2008, =
the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street nearly =
destroyed the U.S. and global economy. Millions of Americans lost their =
jobs, their homes, and their life savings.

Meanwhile, the American middle class continues to disappear, poverty is =
increasing, and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing =
wider and wider by the day. But the American people are catching on. They =
also know that a handful of people on Wall Street have extraordinary power =
over the economic and political life of our country.

We must act now to change that. Our goal must be to create a financial =
system and an economy that works for all Americans, not just a handful of =
billionaires.

There are eight points to my plan, and I want to go through each of them =
here because I think it's important for our campaign to discuss specific =
policies with our supporters. Some of this may seem a little in the weeds, =
but I trust our supporters to be able to handle this kind of policy =
discussion.

Here's my plan for what I will do with Wall Street when I am president:

- Break up huge financial institutions in the first year of my =
administration. Within the first 100 days of my administration, I will =
require the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a "Too Big to Fail" =
list of commercial banks, shadow banks, and insurance companies whose =
failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the U.S. economy without a =
taxpayer bailout. Within one year, my administration will break these =
institutions up so that they no longer pose a grave threat to the economy.

- Reinstate a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate =
traditional banking from risky investment banking and insurance services. =
It is not enough to tell Wall Street to "cut it out," propose a few new =
rules and slap on some fines. Under my administration, financial =
institutions will no longer be too big to fail or too big to manage. Wall =
Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in =
risky financial instruments. If an institution is too big to fail, it is =
too big to exist.

- End too-big-to-jail. We live in a country today that has an economy that =
is rigged, a campaign finance system which is corrupt, and a criminal =
justice system which often does not dispense justice. The average American =
sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing =
marijuana. But when it comes to Wall Street executives -- some of the most =
wealthy and powerful people in this country whose illegal behavior hurt =
millions of Americans -- somehow nothing happens to them. No jail time. No =
police record. No justice.

Not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the =
near collapse of our entire economy. That will change under my =
Administration. "Equal Justice Under Law" will not just be words engraved =
on the entrance of the Supreme Court. It will be the standard that applies =
to Wall Street and all Americans.

- Establish a tax on Wall Street to discourage reckless gambling and =
encourage productive investments in the job-creating economy. We will use =
the revenue from this tax to make public colleges and universities tuition =
free. During the financial crisis, the middle class of this country bailed =
out Wall Street. Now, it's Wall Street's turn to help the middle class.

- Cap Credit Card Interest Rates and ATM Fees. We have got to stop =
financial institutions from ripping off the American people by charging =
sky-high interest rates and outrageous fees. In my view, it is =
unacceptable that Americans are paying a $4 or $5 fee each time they go to =
the ATM. And it is unacceptable that millions of Americans are paying =
credit card interest rates of 20 or 30 percent.

The Bible has a term for this practice. It's called usury. And in The =
Divine Comedy, Dante reserved a special place in the Seventh Circle of =
Hell for sinners who charged people usurious interest rates. Today, we =
don't need the hellfire and the pitchforks, we don't need the rivers of =
boiling blood, but we do need a national usury law.

We need to cap interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15 =
percent. I would also cap ATM fees at $2.

- Allow Post Offices to Offer Banking Services. We also need to give =
Americans affordable banking options. The reality is that, unbelievably, =
millions of low-income Americans live in communities where there are no =
normal banking services. Today, if you live in a low-income community and =
you need to cash a check or get a loan to pay for a car repair or a =
medical emergency, where do you go? You go to a payday lender who could =
charge an interest rate of over 300 percent and trap you into a vicious =
cycle of debt. That is unacceptable.

We need to stop payday lenders from ripping off millions of Americans. =
Post offices exist in almost every community in our country. One important =
way to provide decent banking opportunities for low-income communities is =
to allow the U.S. Postal Service to engage in basic banking services, and =
that's what I will fight for.

- Reform Credit Rating Agencies. We cannot have a safe and sound financial =
system if we cannot trust the credit agencies to accurately rate financial =
products. The only way we can restore that trust is to make sure credit =
rating agencies cannot make a profit from Wall Street. Under my =
administration, we will turn for-profit credit rating agencies into =
non-profit institutions, independent from Wall Street. No longer will Wall =
Street be able to pick and choose which credit agency will rate their =
products.

- Reform the Federal Reserve. We need to structurally reform the Federal =
Reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs =
of ordinary Americans, not just the billionaires on Wall Street. It is =
unacceptable that the Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very =
bankers it is in charge of regulating. When Wall Street was on the verge =
of collapse, the Federal Reserve acted with a fierce sense of urgency to =
save the financial system. We need the Fed to act with the same boldness =
to combat the unemployment crisis and fulfill its full employment mandate.

So my message to you is straightforward: I'll rein in Wall Street's =
reckless behavior so they can't crash our economy again.

Will Wall Street like me? No. Will they begin to play by the rules if I'm =
president? You better believe it.

That is our plan to create an economy that works for all Americans, not =
just a handful of billionaires. If you agree with what we want to do, add =
your name to say that you stand with me:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/wall-street

No president alone, not Bernie Sanders or anyone else, can effectively =
address the crises facing the working families of this country without a =
powerful grassroots movement. When we stand together, there is nothing we =
cannot accomplish.

Thank you for standing with me.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

<p style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; line-height: 140%;">
	To those on Wall Street, let me be very clear. Greed is not good. In =
fact, the greed of Wall Street and corporate America is destroying the =
fabric of our nation. And here is a promise I will make as president: If =
Wall Street does not end its greed, we will end it for them.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; line-height: 140%;">
	As most people know, in the 1990s and later, financial interests spent =
billions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to force =
through Congress the deregulation of Wall Street, the repeal of the =
Glass-Steagall Act, and the weakening of consumer protection laws.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; line-height: 140%;">
	They paid this money to show the American people all that they could do =
with that freedom. Well, they sure showed the American people. In 2008, =
the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street nearly =
destroyed the U.S. and global economy. Millions of Americans lost their =
jobs, their homes, and their life savings.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; line-height: 140%;">
	Meanwhile, the American middle class continues to disappear, poverty is =
increasing, and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing =
wider and wider by the day. But the American people are catching on. They =
also know that a handful of people on Wall Street have extraordinary power =
over the economic and political life of our country.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; line-height: 140%;">
	We must act now to change that. Our goal must be to create a financial =
system and an economy that works for all Americans, not just a handful of =
billionaires.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; line-height: 140%;">
	There are eight points to my plan, and I want to go through each of them =
here because I think it's important for our campaign to discuss specific =
policies with our supporters. Some of this may seem a little in the weeds, =
but I trust our supporters to be able to handle this kind of policy =
discussion.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; line-height: 140%;">
	Here's my plan for what I will do with Wall Street when I am =
president:</p>
<blockquote style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; =
line-height:140%;">
	<strong>Break up huge financial institutions in the first year of my =
administration.</strong> Within the first 100 days of my administration, I =
will require the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a &ldquo;Too Big =
to Fail&rdquo; list of commercial banks, shadow banks, and insurance =
companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the U.S. economy =
without a taxpayer bailout. Within one year, my administration will break =
these institutions up so that they no longer pose a grave threat to the =
economy.</blockquote>
<blockquote style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; =
line-height:140%;">
	<strong>Reinstate a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate =
traditional banking from risky investment banking and insurance =
services.</strong> It is not enough to tell Wall Street to "cut it out," =
propose a few new rules and slap on some fines. Under my administration, =
financial institutions will no longer be too big to fail or too big to =
manage. Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling =
trillions in risky financial instruments. If an institution is too big to =
fail, it is too big to exist.</blockquote>

Dear Friend,

Last night I introduced Bernie to an overflowing town meeting at =
Manchester Community College. I had a minute to tell my own story--of =
moving to America as a refugee from Sudan, of graduating from college, and =
of struggling with student loan debt. I talked about how I get to work =
every day to elect Bernie Sanders as the 45th President of the United =
States because I know he'll make America work for all of us.

Throughout the evening, I heard our supporters--people like you--cheer =
when Bernie called out the bigotry of Donald Trump. I saw you nod your =
heads in agreement when Bernie explained that the Koch brothers want to =
end Social Security and Medicare--and that we have to stop them.

My fellow organizers have similar stories from other events over the past =
few days. We saw young people and seniors standing up for each other in =
Londonderry and Laconia. We listened to a teacher ask about making the =
classroom better for his students in Plaistow. And in Newmarket, we heard =
a young wife explain the health care struggles of her husband, a veteran.

At each and every event, Bernie has consistently asked for one thing: our =
help. He can't fix all of this alone--no one person can. We can only solve =
these problems together. And as much as he wants you to vote for him, he =
needs you to be involved in the hard work required to win real change so =
that we can have a future to believe in. That starts with our =
get-out-the-vote (GOTV) program beginning on Saturday.

Will you help Bernie win New Hampshire by volunteering at our GOTV kickoff =
this weekend?

Friend,

Later today, Donald Trump will hold one of his campaign events in =
Burlington, Vermont -- the city where Bernie was mayor, and the city from =
which we are running our campaign for president.

Donald Trump has been attacking Bernie for weeks now, and we expect more =
of the same tonight. There's a reason he's coming to Burlington. Trump =
wants people to think that in our hometown, he has more support than us.

Well, you and I know that's not true. But there's a good way we can stick =
it to Trump: by showing that a billionaire is no match for our political =
revolution.

Donate $3 to show the strength of our movement while Donald Trump is in =
Bernie's backyard:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our--political--revolution?refc=
ode=3Dem160107v1full

I don't know if you've seen one of these Donald Trump events, but they can =
get pretty ugly.

So here's what I want to do. Let me know if you're with me.

When Donald Trump tries to tell Vermont that climate change isn't real, =
show that you stand with Bernie's plan to act swiftly to save our planet.

When Donald Trump says that he wants to deport immigrants, or ban Muslims =
from entering the country, or build a wall at our southern border, show =
that you stand with Bernie's plan for a humane immigration policy that =
unites families.

When Donald Trump tells Burlington that billionaires like him know what's =
best for the economy, show that you stand with Bernie to make an economy =
that works for all Americans, not just the wealthy.

And when Donald Trump tries to say that he can be elected president, show =
that you stand with Bernie Sanders, the Democratic candidate who is best =
able to defeat Trump in the general election.

Contribute $3 to Bernie's campaign to send a message to Donald Trump that =
our political revolution will best blustering billionaires any day of the =
week:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our--political--revolution?refc=
ode=3Dem160107v1full

Our campaign is the best firewall preventing Donald Trump and his =
dangerous rhetoric from ever getting into the White House. And today, we =
can make him pay for it.

This'll be yuge.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

What exists all over America today is that millions and millions of people =
- working people, young people - they look at the political process and =
they say, "Not for me. I don't know what these guys are doing but it sure =
is not relevant to my life. No, I'm not going to vote." And so we have =
millions of people who don't vote. We have other people who go into the =
polling booth, they hold their nose, and they vote for what they perceive =
to be the lesser of two evils.

We have got to do better than that on February 9th because the stakes are =
so high in this election. That's why today I am asking for your support. =
Please click here to commit to vote for our campaign in New =
Hampshire:https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/commit-to-vote-for-bernie

When I won my first race to become mayor of Burlington, it was by just 10 =
votes. But the point I want to make is not that I won the race by such a =
small margin to everybody's great shock. It is how we won that election =
that became a political lesson that has stayed with me for my whole life.

What I learned is that if you listen to what people have to say and what =
they need, and if you do your best, they begin to participate in the =
political process. They come out to vote.

What we did is we said to the low-income people in the city who did not =
think they were getting a fair shake in terms of city services, "We're =
going to stand with you."

And we talked to the unions. We said, "Look, you're working hard. You =
deserve a fair shake in terms of contract negotiations."

And we talked to women who had never had an opportunity to get into city =
hall at that time and we said, "We're going to open the door to everybody =
- not just men. You're not represented at city hall, and we're going to =
fix that."

And we talked to the environmentalists in the community who were concerned =
by a number of projects that were anti-environmental.

We put together a coalition. It was a group of people who came together =
with the belief that we should open the doors of government, that we =
should allow everybody in, that government should not just work for the =
political establishment, for the big money interests, but it should work =
for all people.

That's the kind of coalition we're trying to build now, and it starts with =
people from all walks of life committing to vote for our campaign in New =
Hampshire:

We need you with us. Commit to vote for me on February 9th in New =
Hampshire: https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/commit-to-vote-for-bernie

The powers that be - corporate America, Wall Street, the insurance =
companies, the drug companies, the military-industrial complex - these =
guys are enormously powerful. And the only way that we can defeat them, =
the only way we can transform America, the only way we can have a =
government which begins to work for working people rather than the =
wealthiest people in this country is by putting together an unprecedented =
grassroots movement.

That's why I am calling for a political revolution where people become =
deeply involved in the political process, where we develop coalition =
politics and where people start talking to each other and paying attention =
in a way that we have never seen before.

The first step we must take is to shock the political establishment by =
winning the New Hampshire primary and let me tell you, I think we can =
absolutely win. But it's going to take all of us coming together. That's =
why I need you now:

Click here to join with your neighbors, friends and family in voting for =
our campaign on February 9th: =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/commit-to-vote-for-bernie

I've been telling people at our town meetings and rallies all over the =
country that we really can accomplish anything if we stand together. And I =
know if we do that on February 9th, we will win in New Hampshire.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

	Sisters and Brothers,</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	What exists all over America today is that millions and millions of =
people - working people, young people - they look at the political process =
and they say, "Not for me. I don't know what these guys are doing but it =
sure is not relevant to my life. No, I'm not going to vote." And so we =
have millions of people who don't vote. We have other people who go into =
the polling booth, they hold their nose, and they vote for what they =
perceive to be the lesser of two evils.

<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
When I won my first race to become mayor of Burlington, it was by just 10 =
votes. But the point I want to make is not that I won the race by such a =
small margin to everybody's great shock. It is how we won that election =
that became a political lesson that has stayed with me for my whole life. =
</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
What I learned is that if you listen to what people have to say and what =
they need, and if you do your best, they begin to participate in the =
political process. They come out to vote. </p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
What we did is we said to the low-income people in the city who did not =
think they were getting a fair shake in terms of city services, "We're =
going to stand with you."</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">

And we talked to the unions. We said, "Look, you're working hard. You =
deserve a fair shake in terms of contract negotiations."</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">

And we talked to women who had never had an opportunity to get into city =
hall at that time and we said, "We're going to open the door to everybody =
- not just men. You're not represented at city hall, and we're going to =
fix that."</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">

And we talked to the environmentalists in the community who were concerned =
by a number of projects that were anti-environmental.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">

We put together a coalition. It was a group of people who came together =
with the belief that we should open the doors of government, that we =
should allow everybody in, that government should not just work for the =
political establishment, for the big money interests, but it should work =
for all people.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">

That's the kind of coalition we're trying to build now, and it starts with =
people from all walks of life committing to vote for our campaign in New =
Hampshire:</p>

<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">

The powers that be - corporate America, Wall Street, the insurance =
companies, the drug companies, the military-industrial complex - these =
guys are enormously powerful. And the only way that we can defeat them, =
the only way we can transform America, the only way we can have a =
government which begins to work for working people rather than the =
wealthiest people in this country is by putting together an unprecedented =
grassroots movement.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">

That's why I am calling for a political revolution where people become =
deeply involved in the political process, where we develop coalition =
politics and where people start talking to each other and paying attention =
in a way that we have never seen before.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">

The first step we must take is to shock the political establishment by =
winning the New Hampshire primary and let me tell you, I think we can =
absolutely win. But it's going to take all of us coming together. That's =
why I need you now:</p>

We're counting on huge numbers from all of our supporters-- and especially =

While this event is hosted by Dartmouth, we are excited that it's open to =
the public and we look forward to showing them what a political revolution =
looks like.

We're counting on huge numbers from all of our supporters-- and especially =
our young voters in the Hanover area. And like everything in this =
campaign, you've exceeded every goal we've set. We hope that by attending =
this event you'll be inspired to join the fight for tuition-free college, =
combating climate change,and ending corruption in politics.

While this event is hosted by Dartmouth, we are excited that it's open to =
the public and we look forward to showing them what a political revolution =
looks like. </p>

Brothers and Sisters -

Earlier today, Hillary Clinton's campaign unleashed a series of vicious =
and coordinated attacks against Bernie's universal health care plan. They =
falsely claimed Bernie's plan would end the Children's Health Insurance =
Program, dismantle Medicare and strip millions of people of their =
coverage.

Here is the truth: Bernie's plan would guarantee health care as a right =
for every man, woman, and child, and it would be implemented in every =
state in the country regardless of who is governor.

We have made tremendous gains in Iowa, but if we lost because Hillary =
Clinton's campaign scared voters into thinking Bernie's plan would cost =
them their coverage, it could set our vision for universal health care =
back at least a generation.

We simply cannot let that happen.

We are SO CLOSE. With Iowa less than three weeks away, your $3 =
contribution to Bernie's campaign today could mean the difference between =
victory and defeat for our campaign:

m160112healthcare

I want to close with something important. This campaign isn't about Bernie =
Sanders and it isn't about Hillary Clinton. It's about the very real =
issues facing working families across this country. It is a national =
disgrace that the United States is the only major country in the world =
that does not offer health care as a right.

We need a president who will fight for the 29 million Americans without =
health care. That's what this campaign, and your contribution, is about.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

Dear Friend,

Over these past few months we've been able to accomplish so much together, =
and I know these next 27 days are going to fly by. That's why, as we get =
into these final grueling weeks it's important to remember our hard-earned =
successes and why we fight so damn hard. And why we need to commit to keep =
fighting.

VOLUNTEER: map.berniesanders.com=20

Our movement is full of people who are experiencing struggles, but who are =
making the choice to turn anger and despair into a political revolution.

We're in this with Bob from Cheshire who told us the story of a family =
member's struggle with addition: One of my family members is addicted to =
heroin and has been for 10 years. They are lucky to be alive but what a =
hard, impossible 10 years it has been. But we need reasonable and =
affordable help, and not prison for addiction.

We're in this with Byron from Rockingham who said he's with us to stand up =
for the environment: We cannot afford to mortgage the future of our =
children and grandchildren to the fossil fuel industry.

We're in this with Avis from Belknap who stood with Bernie to expand =
Social Security: I am a retired, disabled woman living on SSDI. It is =
impossible to make ends meet on the amount of money I receive, and I =
worked hard all my life.

These are just a few stories of those who have joined our political =
revolution, voices that echo the hopes of so many of us. As we knock doors =
and make phone calls to ensure that Bernie wins the first-in-the nation =
primary on February 9th, we're going to remember Bob, Byron, and Avis.

It's because of supporters like you that we've taken over 100,000 actions =
online to support expanding healthcare, stopping the TPP, protecting our =
social security, standing with Planned Parenthood, and many more important =
issues central to our movement.

It's because of volunteers that we've completed over 5000 volunteer shifts =
and knocked on over 180,000 doors across the Granite State. Now, we need =
to bring this home.

Are you in for the final few weeks? Sign up here to talk to your neighbors =
this weekend: map.berniesanders.com

Together, we can build a future to believe in.

In solidarity,

I'm an organizer for Bernie. Every day, I talk with my volunteers about =
how Bernie's health care plan would guarantee health care as a right and =
would be implemented in every state regardless of who is governor. That's =
important for everyone in New Hampshire because right now, the State =
Legislature is getting ready to debate if Medicaid expansion will be =
reauthorized. Healthcare should be a right, not a whim of elected =
officials. Will you join us in demanding that Medicaid expansion is =
reauthorized in New Hampshire?

It's a pretty simple concept: protect people's health coverage today while =
we work to win universal health care in the future. And, this is personal =
for me, because I'm six months into remission from cancer.

ADD YOUR NAME: =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/protectmedicaidexpansionNH

Last year, I was a psychiatric social worker working with low-income and =
at-risk people. Listening to my clients, I heard about the struggles they =
faced in trying to prove eligibility for Medicaid. When they did end up =
with coverage, their lives improved and they were able to have consistent =
treatment. It's disappointing in America that healthcare is not a right =
but a privilege -- and that's what we are trying to fix. In the meantime, =
health insurance is a lifesaver.

I should know because quality health insurance saved my life. Thanks to =
those before me who organized my workplace, I was a member of a union. So =
when I was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer, I had top-level health =
insurance, paid medical leave and the security of knowing that I wouldn't =
end up in debt from expensive treatments. I'm a cancer survivor because I =
had a job with a union and health insurance. Everyone in America should =
have access to that same level of care.

That's why I quit my incredible job and came to work for Bernie in New =
Hampshire. But it's wrong that so many others face illness or injury =
without access to health care. It's wrong that another young woman my age =
who doesn't have insurance would not be able to get the care she deserves. =
And that's why I am asking you to fight to protect Medicaid expansion =
while we work to elect Bernie.

Will you join Bernie in demanding that New Hampshire reauthorize Medicaid =
expansion this year? It's so important. =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/protectmedicaidexpansionNH

Working on this campaign has filled me with the energy to recover fully =
from my illness. The hope and hard work of all our volunteers gives me =
purpose. Together, we can build a future to believe in.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers -

With just two weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses, the super PAC =
coordinating with Hillary Clinton's campaign is reportedly launching one =
of the most desperate and vile attacks imaginable: they are insinuating =
Bernie is too old and unhealthy to be our next president.

Let me be very clear with you: Bernie is in excellent health. But this =
personal attack is another example of a sickness in our democracy when it =
is so easy for millionaires and billionaires to buy up candidates and =
elections.

We are just three points behind in Iowa, but closing every day. We can't =
let super PAC attacks on Bernie's health and health care plan scare people =
away from voting for Bernie.

Your $3 contribution to Bernie's campaign could be the difference between =
victory and defeat in the Democratic primary for our political revolution. =
Make one today.

In spite of these Karl Rove-style attacks, Bernie's going to stay focused =
on the real issues impacting working families across the country. While he =
does that, we can make the millionaires and billionaires coordinating with =
the Clinton campaign pay a price for their attacks.
In solidarity,

Friend,=20

Bernie's visiting New Hampshire this week and he's bringing along one of =
the leading environmentalists, Bill McKibben, to join him for part of the =
trip. As your organizers, we're excited to invite you take some time to =
ask Bernie about the issues that matter to all us--and get ready to help =
us turn out the vote on February 9th.

Are you in?

Dear Friend,=20

The response to Bernie events this week has been so strong that we've had =
to add two more town hall meetings to Bernie's schedule on Friday. We know =
that our movement's strength comes from our supporters--and we want to =
make sure you get a chance to discuss the issues you care about with him =
in North Conway. So make sure you RSVP quickly to join Bernie.

Can Bernie count on you to sign up right now?

RSVP here: https://go.berniesanders.com/page/event/detail/townmeeting/4m3s

We're getting so close to Primary Day! And I've never seen the excitement =
for a political revolution so strong across the Granite State. It's your =
commitment to making America work for everyone, not just the millionaires =
and billionaires that's going to propel us to victory. Well, that and your =
ongoing volunteer work to reach Granite Staters, spread Bernie's message =
about a political revolution, and grow our movement.

I know that we're going to have a great trip with Bernie and then hunker =
down to get out all the votes we need for a win on Primary Day.

Let's do this.

The Supreme Court guaranteed a woman's right to choose in the Roe v. Wade =
decision 43 years ago today. This was a tremendous step to protect women's =
health and to affirm their control of their own bodies.

Unfortunately, since the Roe v. Wade decision, extreme right-wing =
politicians in states have made it more and more difficult for women to =
actually access abortion care, aided in many cases by the federal Hyde =
Amendment and other anti-abortion policies. Nearly a quarter of these =
restrictions have come in the last five years. This is unacceptable.

The extreme right-wing works tirelessly to make it more difficult for =
women to access reproductive health care. Republicans in office work to =
shut down clinics while extremists terrorize health care providers and =
their patients. Making women travel hundreds of miles, wait weeks for an =
appointment and face harassment at the clinic door is a national disgrace.

So today, on the anniversary of this important Supreme Court decision, we =
must affirm not only the right to have an abortion, but we must protect =
the right to access a doctor or clinic who can perform that procedure.

Add your name to mine if you agree we must expand access to reproductive =
health care and protect Roe v. Wade:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/roe-v-wade

We are not going back to the days when women had to risk their lives to =
end an unwanted pregnancy. The decision about abortion must remain a =
decision for a woman and her doctor to make, not the government.

We are not going to allow the extreme right-wing to defund Planned =
Parenthood, we are going to expand it. Planned Parenthood provides vital =
healthcare services for millions of people, who rely on its clinics every =
year for affordable, quality health care services including cancer =
prevention, STI and HIV testing and general primary health care services. =
The current attempt to malign Planned Parenthood is part of a long-term =
smear campaign by people who want to deny women in this country the right =
to control their own bodies.

We are not going back to the days when women did not have full access to =
birth control. Incredibly, almost all of the Republicans in Congress are =
in favor of giving any employer who provides health insurance, or any =
insurance company, the ability to deny coverage for contraception or any =
other kind of procedure if the employer had a "moral" objection to it. =
That is unacceptable.

Under my administration, we will protect and expand the fundamental rights =
of women to control their own bodies. I promise to only nominate Supreme =
Court Justices who support Roe v. Wade. Our Medicare-for-all plan would =
cover reproductive health care, including abortion, because all health =
care is a right, not a privilege. And I would work to repeal the federal =
Hyde Amendment, which currently restricts the federal government from =
spending any money on abortion care. That is wrong, and it will be =
abolished when I am president.

Add your name to mine if you agree we must expand access to reproductive =
health care and protect Roe v. Wade:

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers,=20

Very little will ever get done until we reform our broken and corrupt =
campaign finance system. I hear about it everyday. The economic and =
political systems in this country are stacked against ordinary Americans. =
The rich get richer and they use their wealth to buy elections.

Last Thursday was the sixth-year anniversary of Citizens United, one of =
the most disastrous Supreme Court decisions in my lifetime. This decision =
hinges on the absurd notion that money is speech, that corporations are =
people, and that giving huge piles of undisclosed cash in support of =
politicians in exchange for influence does not constitute corruption.

In essence, this ruling handed millionaires and billionaires -- who have =
already rigged our economy -- unlimited influence in our elections. It =
gave billionaires like the Koch Brothers an even bigger opportunity to =
purchase the House, the Senate, even the White House.

Super PACs -- a direct outgrowth of the Citizens United decision -- are =
enabling the wealthiest people and the largest corporations in this =
country to spend unlimited amounts on elections. We know, for example, =
that the Koch brothers, the second wealthiest family in America, want to =
use the Citizens United decision to buy politicians across the country. =
This election cycle alone, they have committed to spend at least $750 =
million on political activities -- an outrageous sum that is corrupting =
our political process. And I can assure you, brothers and sisters, they =
won't be spending that money with the interests of working families, =
women, and seniors in mind. That is simply unacceptable, and it's time for =
the American people to rise up and reclaim our democracy.

I need you to sign up to volunteer during the final four days of the New =
Hampshire primary. Working together is our path to defeating big money and =
overturning Citizens United.

Can I count on you to sign up to volunteer?  =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/nh-gotv

=20
Let's be honest and acknowledge what we are talking about. We are talking =
about a rapid movement in this country towards a political system in which =
a handful of very wealthy people and special interests will determine who =
gets elected or who does not get elected. That is not what this country is =
supposed to be about. That was not Abraham Lincoln's vision of a =
government of the people, by the people, and for the people.

The need for real campaign finance reform is not a progressive issue. It =
is not a conservative issue. It is an American issue. It is an issue that =
should concern all Americans, regardless of their political point of view, =
who wish to preserve the essence of the longest standing democracy in the =
world -- a government that represents all of the people and not a handful =
of powerful and wealthy special interests.

Our campaign is doing so well because we are telling the truth about the =
reality of American life today. We are talking about a reality in which =
most of the new wealth and income in this country are going to the top one =
percent while working families are struggling more than at any point since =
the Great Depression.

My vision for American democracy is a nation in which all people, =
regardless of their income, can participate in the political process, and =
can run for office without begging for contributions from the wealthy and =
the powerful. While other politicians will make you the same promise, I am =
the only candidate running for the Democratic nomination who does not have =
a super PAC. And I am the only one who is telling the truth about the =
corrupting influence of Wall Street bankers and the obscenely wealthy in =
our elections.

We have to create a political revolution where working Americans come =
together to say they have had ENOUGH of the billionaire class buying our =
elections to enrich themselves while everyone else gets poorer. More than =
ever, we need a president who has a firm commitment to the American people =
-- and no one else.

Sign up today to commit to volunteering in New Hampshire between February =
6th-9th. These are the final moments to make sure every one of our =
supporters near you are reminded to get out to vote on primary day.

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/nh-gotv

Our vision for democracy should be one in which candidates are speaking to =
the vast majority of our people - working people, the middle class, =
low-income people, the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor - and =
discussing with them their ideas as to how we can improve lives for all =
people in this country.

I believe this vision of America can be a reality once again. We just have =
to do something unprecedented in the coming months -- defy the odds and =
win the Democratic nomination for President of the United States.

I am glad you are standing with us.

In solidarity,
Bernie Sanders

Dear Friend,=20

Over the past few months, every time we've talked to voters about making =
college affordable, medicare for all, and creating an economy that works =
for all of us, we've grown our grassroots movement.  Now, with the =
February 9th primary just around the corner, each voter we speak to helps =
us secure our victory in the Granite State. =20

So, can Bernie count on you to attend a canvass near you on Sunday?

What: Plymouth Canvass at Field Office
Where:Plymouth Field Office
135 Main St.=20
Plymouth, NH 03264
When: Sunday,January 31=CB=A2=E1=B5=97
9:00 am EST=20

=20
We're looking forward to seeing you then.
In solidarity,=20

Dear Friend,

The first thing Bernie is doing after the Iowa Caucus tomorrow is coming =
straight to New Hampshire. When I see him, at our first Get Out the Vote =
rally, in Keene on Tuesday, I want to include your name when I hand him a =
list of all of our volunteers who signed up for a GOTV shift. We need to =
fill 500 more shifts by noon tomorrow. Will you sign up right now to bring =
us closer to our goal?

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/nh-gotv

=20
I can't wait to tell him about all the volunteers we have confirmed for =
GOTV weekend. After all, Bernie explains all the time that this campaign =
isn't about him--it's about us--all of us working to build a political =
revolution. We're doing this today so that this time next year, we're able =
to work with Bernie to expand Social Security, make public college tuition =
free, pass pay equity, combat the threat of climate change, and so much =
more. But winning the first-in-the-nation primary is a key moment for our =
movement--and you're one of the keys to our victory.

Are you in? Will you be a GOTV volunteer this weekend? =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/nh-gotv


As a GOTV volunteer, you're one of the last members of our movement who =
will be able to remind voters near you to cast their ballot for Bernie. =
You'll be helping out a staging location with important jobs--phone =
banking, knocking doors, and more. Sign up here, and we'll get you slotted =
into a spot that works for you.

We've always said - this race will be close. We're building a long-term =
movement to make America a country where we all have opportunity, not just =
the bankers on Wall Street. We have to win on February 9th so that our =
teammates in Nevada and South Carolina are propelled by our victory in =
their own states. We're working hard to win New Hampshire so that we can =
win the Democratic nomination.

We always exceed every goal we set. With your commitment to our movement =
and to electing Bernie, I'm confident we'll get 500 new GOTV volunteer =
shifts by noon tomorrow. And I'm eager to let Bernie know that you signed =
up.

Sign up here: https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/nh-gotv

Together, we'll have an incredibly powerful GOTV weekend.

In solidarity,

Brandon Maheu
Primary Director
New Hampshire for Bernie

Sisters and Brothers -

Tonight we accomplished what the corporate media and political =
establishment once believed was impossible: after trailing Hillary Clinton =
in Iowa throughout this entire campaign, it looks as if we will leave the =
state with roughly the same number of delegates.

I want to be clear with you about what this really means. Tonight's result =
is a victory for our political revolution. We have proved that when people =
come together, anything is possible.

New Hampshire votes next, where we have a slight lead in the polls. If we =
win there, we'll have all the momentum. What counts now is how we respond =
in this moment:

Make a $3 contribution to ensure our campaign wins the New Hampshire =
primary one week from Tuesday:

https://go.berniesanders.com/how_we_respond

When we started this campaign, almost everyone wrote us off. We were down =
41 percent in the polls... and those were some of the good ones. They said =
our ideas were radical and that we could never compete with the big money =
fundraising of Hillary Clinton and her super PACs.

Well, you showed them tonight.

Victory is within our reach. But winning will require the active =
participation of millions of Americans in every community across the =
country -- nothing less than a political revolution.

Please make a contribution to our campaign tonight:

https://go.berniesanders.com/how_we_respond

On to New Hampshire.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Last night's results were a victory for our political revolution. Now, =
we're taking the baton from our teammates in Iowa to continue the =
momentum. A win here, a week from today, will power us into Nevada and =
South Carolina.

That's why Bernie needs you to show up this evening for one of our first =
GOTV rallies in the Granite State.    Can we count on you?

Dear Bernie Supporter,

Bernie said it best when discussing Iowa-- "What we proved, what we are =
proving in this campaign, and what we will prove next week is what we have =
said all along: when we stand together, anything is possible."

Volunteering together during the final four days before the New Hampshire =
primary is the only way we will go from a virtual tie for our movement to =
defeating the establishment. Primary after primary in New Hampshire, more =
than 40% of voters don't make up their minds until a few days before they =
vote. And your voice as a neighbor is the strongest voice to grow our =
political revolution. Can you take a moment right now to sign up to =
volunteer?

Sisters and Brothers -

When we started our campaign, we were down 44 points in New Hampshire. =
Tonight, just four days away from the state's primary, our political =
revolution has a real chance to win.

If you watched tonight's debate, you saw the important differences between =
our visions for America. As I said in the debate, I believe what is =
required in this moment is to think big.

I believe that we can provide health care for every man, woman, and child =
in this country. I believe that we can create an economy that works for =
everyone, and not just a handful of wealthy elites. And I believe that we =
can put an end to millionaires and billionaires buying our candidates and =
elections.

But we have to do well in New Hampshire if we're going to move that vision =
forward. So I have to ask directly:

Can I count on you to contribute $3 to our campaign ahead of Tuesday's New =
Hampshire primary? It is a critical state for our campaign, so your =
contribution right now is more important than ever before:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/against-all-odds

A few days ago, the people of Iowa showed that, against all odds, our =
political revolution has a chance to win this election. I don't take money =
from millionaires and billionaires. There is no super PAC waiting in the =
wings. But I know that if we stand together, I believe we can do even =
better in New Hampshire next week.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Friend,

On Tuesday, you'll finally be able to cast your ballot for Bernie and the =
political revolution. But first, we want to make sure you know where to =
vote on Tuesday! We don't have your correct home address -- enter it here =
and get your voting location:

CONFIRM YOUR ADDRESS TO VOTE ON TUESDAY =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/nhupdate

Remember, you can register to vote at your polling location if your voter =
registration isn't updated. This is also the first election where you will =
be asked to show photo ID. We encourage you bring your ID with you to vote =
but if you don't have ID or can't find it -- you can still vote by signing =
a form they give you on site. Don't let anything stop you from voting for =
Bernie on Tuesday.

Let's bring it home on Tuesday. =20

In solidarity,

New Hampshire for Bernie

P.S. Can you make sure your friends know where to vote on Tuesday? Share =
this link with them to look up their voting location and answer their =
questions about voting: https://berniesanders.com/nh

Please read Bernie's note below about what our country could be like eight =
years from now, and then help make that a reality by making a plan to vote =
for Tuesday's New Hampshire primary. There's snow in the forecast, and the =
way to ensure you vote is to make a plan to vote so you can help Bernie =
win tomorrow.=20

Sisters and Brothers -

I want you to imagine eight years from now:

The minimum wage is a living wage and students are graduating college =
without the crushing debt stifling their ability to pursue the career of =
their dreams.

Health care is recognized as a right for every man, woman, and child, and =
the United States is leading the world in fighting climate change.

There is no bank that is too big to fail, no banker too powerful to jail, =
and we've leveled the playing field so that the billionaire class is no =
longer able to buy and sell our candidates and elections.

When that happens, they will say it all started tomorrow night in New =
Hampshire with your vote. We have overcome not just a forty point deficit =
in the polls, but the sneers of the corporate media and opposition from =
political elites and billionaire super PACs.

But in order to make this happen you have to show up and vote tomorrow, =
and the best way to make sure you vote is to make a plan.

MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/nhvoting?source=3Dem160208

What we are doing on this campaign is building a political revolution =
large enough and powerful enough to take this country back from the =
billionaire class, and we are hopeful that tomorrow night will be a =
turning point for our movement.

Years from now, when you are looking back on everything we've accomplished =
together, I want you to be able to say that not only did you vote, you =
stayed involved in our revolution.

If we win tomorrow night, our victory will send a message, loudly and =
clearly, that "ENOUGH is ENOUGH!" This great nation and its government =
belong to all of the people, and not a handful of billionaires and their =
super PACs.

Make a plan to vote for tomorrow's primary. =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/nhvoting?source=3Dem160208

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers,

I've said it since day one: I can't do this alone. This campaign is about =
creating a political revolution - millions of people joining together to =
transform our country economically, politically, socially and =
environmentally.

Today's it's your turn. Your vote for me today is a vote for our =
revolution to continue.

This is a people's campaign, and the single most important thing you can =
do today is to vote before the polls close. Please make sure you know =
where to vote.

MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW & WHERE TO VOTE TODAY
https://berniesanders.com/new-hampshire/vote/

By voting today, you will send a message, loudly and clearly, that this =
country belongs to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.

This campaign isn't about me. This campaign is about US.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers,

The morning rush at the polls is over, and we want to check in and see if =
you've voted yet. If you haven't yet, that's OK -- but please remember to =
vote for Bernie today.

So, have you voted yet?

YES, I VOTED! https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/nh-vote-yes

I STILL NEED TO VOTE https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/nh-vote-not-yet

Let's continue to build this revolution by voting together today. And if =
you have any questions about or problems with voting, or even just need a =
ride to go vote, give us a call at (844) 502-5948.

In solidarity,

New Hampshire for Bernie

Sisters and Brothers -

We just won the New Hampshire primary.

I am about to head downstairs to address an enthusiastic group of =
supporters and volunteers. I want to thank you, New Hampshire, for helping =
us win. But what I am about to tell you is important:

There are 14 primaries and caucuses over the next three weeks, and you can =
be certain that our victory tonight will prompt a desperate response from =
the nation's financial elite and the political establishment who want to =
stop our campaign to transform America.

Who knows what they're going to throw at us next. All I know is we must be =
ready to respond, organize, and win.
Make a $3 contribution to our campaign tonight and we are going to win =
this Democratic primary, the White House, and take our country back from =
the billionaire class:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-won-NH

Nine months ago, if you told somebody that we would win the New Hampshire =
primary, they would not have believed you. Not at all. Too bold, they =
would have said. Not enough money to compete against the billionaires.

You showed them tonight.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Take a look at the response to the speech Bernie gave tonight -- each one =
of these is a real contribution from a hard working American who has HAD =
ENOUGH of a corrupt campaign system in which Wall Street and the =
billionaire class are able to buy our elections.

Add your $3 contribution to theirs right now.

https://go.berniesanders.com/must-see

Tonight we sent a profound message the political and economic =
establishment in this country: we will no longer accept a corrupt campaign =
finance system that undermining American democracy and a rigged economy in =
which ordinary Americans work longer hours for lower wages, while almost =
all new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.

There are 14 primaries and caucuses over the next three weeks, so this is =
an absolutely pivotal moment for our campaign. How we respond in this =
moment, while we have the momentum, will make all the difference.

Can Bernie count on you to make a $3 contribution to our campaign right =
now? You can do that here:

https://go.berniesanders.com/must-see

What began last week in Iowa, and what voters in New Hampshire confirmed =
tonight is that we are building nothing short of the political revolution =
this moment in time requires.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers -

Last night we sent a message that will echo from Wall Street to =
Washington, from Maine to California. And that is that the government of =
this great nation belongs to all of the people, and not just a handful of =
wealthy campaign contributors and their super PACs.

As you may have heard in my speech last night, I am in New York today. But =
I am not here for a Wall Street fundraiser. This campaign is funded by =
people like you, responding to emails like this -- working Americans -- =
giving an average of $27 apiece, some of whom can hardly afford the =
contribution.

Our success has clearly set off some alarm bells inside of the political =
establishment and among the nation's financial elite. They've thrown =
everything at us but the kitchen sink, and I expect that will be coming =
soon as well.

With 14 primaries and caucuses in the next three weeks, we'll need to be =
ready. That's why I have to ask you directly:

Can I count on you to contribute $3 to our political revolution today? It =
could mean the difference in Nevada, South Carolina, and on Super Tuesday.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-best-chance

What everyone learned with the record-breaking turnout in New Hampshire =
last night is that our campaign is the Democratic Party's best chance to =
harness the energy and enthusiasm we will need to succeed in November.

When voter turnout is high, Democrats and progressives win. When voter =
turnout is low and people are demoralized, Republicans win.

What we are building together is a political revolution that will bring =
tens of millions of people together. Working people who have given up not =
the political process. Blacks and whites, Latinos, Asian Americans, Native =
Americans, straight and gay, male and female, people who were born in =
America and people who immigrated here.

And what we are saying, loudly and clearly, is that this government =
belongs to all of us, and not just a wealthy few. That is what this =
campaign is about. That is the political revolution.

Make a $3 contribution to our campaign today to help grow the political =
revolution that will win the White House and take back our country from =
the billionaire class:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-best-chance

I am overwhelmed, and I am moved by your continued support. And I know =
that if we continue to stand together, we will win.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

<a href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">last =
night</a> is that our campaign is the Democratic Party&rsquo;s best chance =
to harness the energy and enthusiasm we will need to succeed <a href=3D"#" =
style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">in November.</a></p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	When voter turnout is high, Democrats and progressives win. When voter =
turnout is low and people are demoralized, Republicans win.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	What we are building together is a political revolution that will bring =
tens of millions of people together. Working people who have given up not =
the political process. Blacks and whites, Latinos, Asian Americans, Native =
Americans, straight and gay, male and female, people who were born in =
America and people who immigrated here.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	And what we are saying, loudly and clearly, is that this government =
belongs to all of us, and not just a wealthy few. That is what this =
campaign is about. That is the political revolution.</p>

Sisters and Brothers -

I am going to share some information with you that will send shivers down =
the spines of the nation's financial elite and political establishment:

Since the polls closed in New Hampshire yesterday evening, we have =
received more than 150,000 contributions from people across the country =
for a grand total of $5.2 million... in just 18 hours.

So we've set an audacious goal, but one we can reach together if everyone =
chips in:

Contribute $3 right now to help our campaign reach $6 million raised =
online since the polls closed last night in New Hampshire:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/what-we-do-next

What we are doing on this campaign is telling the billionaire class and =
the 1 percent of this country that they cannot have it all. That we will =
no longer continue to accept a corrupt campaign finance system that is =
undermining our democracy. That the people of this country want real =
change.

But as we've seen, the protectors of the status quo will not go down =
without a fight. Two weeks ago, we learned that Wall Street contributed =
over $15 million to one of Hillary Clinton's super PACs.

There are 14 primaries and caucuses over the next three weeks, and we =
expect them to ramp up their opposition to our campaign as a result of our =
tremendous success. That's why it's so important we hit this goal:

Contribute $3 right now to help our campaign reach $6 million raised =
online since the polls closed last night in New Hampshire:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/what-we-do-next

When we started this campaign last April, we had no money, no =
organization, and were taking on the most powerful political organization =
in the United States.

Look how far we've come. And if we continue to stand together, we are =
going to win.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

Sisters and Brothers -

Earlier today we set an audacious goal of raising $6 million in =
contributions after the polls closed in New Hampshire.

Well, you already crushed that goal in just a couple hours. So, in the =
spirit of this campaign, we're going to reach for a bigger but difficult =
goal -- raising $7 million by the end of the day today.

I'll be honest -- right now, the math looks difficult to raise another $1 =
million today. But I think it's important for us to try, and not just =
because there are 14 primaries and caucuses over the next three weeks.

Can you help us try to hit our new goal with a $3 contribution today?

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/what-we-do-next

We are doing something absolutely unprecedented together. Even if we don't =
reach the new $7 million goal tonight, know that trying for it is =
important.

Thank you for all you do for our campaign.

In solidarity,

Team Bernie,

Thanks to all of your work and support for Bernie, our revolution is =
moving onward to Nevada and South Carolina. It was a decisive victory and =
we should all be so proud. It's time to take a moment to celebrate all the =
work you did to get us to this point and to commit to stay engaged.

There are three important ways for you to continue your involvement in =
Bernie's campaign.=20
1. Become a weekly donor to the campaign. https://secure.actblue.com/contr=
ibute/page/bernie-weekly?recur_weekly=3Dtrue&refcode=3Dem160211-nh
2. Go help our friends in Massachusetts and Maine! Or make calls into =
Nevada and South Carolina from home or host a phone bank with your local =
team. www.berniesanders.com/phonebank
3. If you've been working with one of our of field organizers, check in =
with them to see if you can help with cleaning out your local field office =
and picking up lawn signs in your neighborhood.

All of us with New Hampshire for Bernie valued every canvass, every phone =
bank, every town hall meeting, and the entire journey we took together. We =
proved that Bernie's right: when we stand together, there isn't anything =
we can't accomplish.

We still have a lot of work to do to win the Democratic nomination. But we =
have no doubt that with your continued participation in our movement, more =
and more people around the country will join with us to fight for a future =
to believe in.

In solidarity,

The whole team at New Hampshire for Bernie

Sisters and Brothers -

I just left the stage at the final debate before 14 caucuses and primaries =
take place over the next three weeks. And the message I sent to those who =
have yet to vote is that the American people cannot afford to wait for =
transformational change.

We've heard a lot of folks in the political establishment, and tonight on =
the stage, say that our ideas are too bold. That the best we can do right =
now is incremental change. But as my dear friend Senator Nina Turner has =
said, "the future of our country is too important to go from yes we can to =
no we can't."

I think our campaign's message is why we left Iowa beating everyone's =
expectations, won by huge margins in New Hampshire, and why we will do so =
well in the 14 contests over the next three weeks. But time is running =
out, and that's why I have to ask you directly:

Make a $3 contribution to our campaign tonight and we will win the =
Democratic primary, the White House, and take our country back from the =
billionaire class:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-cant-wait

The truth is, the forces aligned against us in this primary are too big =
and too powerful for any one candidate to take on alone. The only way we =
win is if we stand together. If we are divided, the big money interests =
will win.

These emails are how we fund this campaign, and that is why your =
contribution tonight is so important.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

Remember that kitchen sink? Here it comes...

The Washington Post just reported that Hillary Clinton's largest super PAC =
is set to spend at least $5 million supporting her campaign in primary =
contests happening in the coming weeks.

This is the same super PAC that came up in last night's debate, the one =
"Clinton attempted to distance herself from," according to the Washington =
Post. The one that recently received $15 million in Wall Street and =
financial industry money to boost her campaign.

Here's the truth: our campaign is funded by more than 3.75 million =
contributions made by people like you, responding to emails like this one. =
You should be very proud of that fact. But if we're going to avoid getting =
beat by the crush of Clinton super PAC spending, we have to ask again:

Make a $3 contribution to our campaign as a way of saying you have had =
more than ENOUGH of super PACs buying our candidates and elections:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/clinton-super-pac

You know that the issue of money in politics is central to our campaign. =
It's one of the reasons we've come so far, so fast. It would be a shame if =
a super PAC flush with Wall Street cash is one of the reasons we come up =
just short in the contests ahead.

That's why your contribution is so important.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

	Remember that kitchen sink? Here it comes&hellip;</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	The <em>Washington Post</em> just reported that Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s =
largest super PAC is set to spend at least $5 million supporting her =
campaign in primary contests happening <a href=3D"#" =
style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">in the coming =
weeks.</a></p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	This is the same super PAC that came up in <a href=3D"#" =
style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">last night&rsquo;s</a> =
debate, the one &ldquo;Clinton attempted to distance herself from,&rdquo; =
according to the <em>Washington Post.</em> The one that recently received =
$15 million in Wall Street and financial industry money to boost her =
campaign.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	Here&rsquo;s the truth: our campaign is funded by more than 3.75 million =
contributions made by people like you, responding to emails like this one. =
You should be very proud of that fact. But if we&rsquo;re going to avoid =
getting beat by the crush of Clinton super PAC spending, we have to ask =
again:</p>

way of saying you have had more than ENOUGH of super PACs buying our =
candidates and elections.</strong></a></p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	You know that the issue of money in politics is central to our campaign. =
It&rsquo;s one of the reasons we&rsquo;ve come so far, so fast. It would =
be a shame if a super PAC flush with Wall Street cash is one of the =
reasons we come up just short in the contests ahead.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">

Sisters and Brothers -

Eight years ago, then-Senator Barack Obama took the noble step of banning =
contributions to the Democratic National Committee from lobbyists.

He said, "They will not fund my party. They will not run our White House. =
And they will not drown out the voice of the American people when I'm =
president of the United States of America."

This week, the DNC reversed that ban and will again get large =
contributions from these interests. Bernie thinks that's an unfortunate =
step backward. Sign our petition if you agree:

Tell the Democratic National Committee you support the restrictions put in =
place by President Obama that ban special interest contributions:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/DNC-ban

One of the many messages our campaign has effectively sent to the =
political establishment of this country is that the American people have =
had ENOUGH of the billionaire class buying elections.

Poll after poll tells us that citizens no longer have confidence in our =
political institutions. If we are to restore a vibrant democracy in this =
country, it is long past time to break the link between money and special =
interest favors in politics, and you can believe that's just what Bernie =
Sanders will do as president.

In 2008 and 2012, Democrats won with President Obama's ban on lobbyist =
money in place. We can do the same in 2016, and the DNC should continue to =
follow the president's leadership and keep the ban in place.

Sign our petition if you agree:

Tell the Democratic National Committee you support the restrictions put in =
place by President Obama that ban lobbyist contributions:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/DNC-ban

Our campaign does not rely on the support of the nation's financial elite. =
Our campaign is funded by almost 4 million individual contributions =
averaging less than $30 a piece.

It's one of the reasons we are doing so well to this point.

Sisters and Brothers -

One of the reasons we are doing so well in this election is because the =
American people understand that you cannot change a corrupt political =
system by taking its money.

Our campaign is funded by almost 4 million individual contributions made =
by people like you responding to emails like this one. That allows Bernie =
to spend time doing what you expect a candidate to do: talking to voters.

By contrast, Hillary Clinton left the campaign trail today and is in New =
York City hosting a fundraiser with financial service executives where =
self-described "champions" give her campaign the maximum amount of money =
allowable under the law.

Here's the truth: The Clinton campaign would not be leaving the campaign =
trail unless they were finding it difficult to keep pace with our historic =
numbers of individual contributions. And they also wouldn't do it unless =
it was for a grotesque amount of money from a small number of super rich =
people. Probably at least $500,000.

Let's double that for Bernie before midnight tonight:

Contribute $3 to our campaign today as a way of saying you have had ENOUGH =
of Wall Street buying our candidates and elections.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/corrupt-political-system

There is no more important time for a big fundraising push. The Nevada =
caucus is in just four days. South Carolina in 11 days, and Super Tuesday =
is two weeks from today.

After how far we've come and everything we've campaigned on, it'd be a =
terrible loss for our movement if we came up short because of a rush of =
Wall Street cash in the final moments of the Democratic primary.

Contribute $3 to our campaign and let's double what Wall Street =
contributed to the Clinton campaign today:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/corrupt-political-system

This is the moment we've been waiting and preparing for. If we continue to =
stand together over these next few weeks, we're going to win.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

Sisters and Brothers -

Our goal in this campaign is to build a movement of people who want to =
take back their country from the billionaire class. We do that one person =
and one contribution at a time, in order to earn the votes we need to win =
the Democratic nomination and the White House.

When we started, no one thought we would get very far. They saw that we =
were up against one of the best-organized political machines in history, =
complete with super PACs and Wall Street money.

Today our opponent hosted a big-dollar fundraiser with the financial elite =
in New York City. I've heard that these events can typically raise =
hundreds of thousands of dollars each, or more -- and their campaign has a =
lot of them on the calendar this month.

So, in the spirit of this campaign, we're going to reach for a big goal -- =
to show the strength of our movement by raising $1 million today. We're on =
our way there right now. Can you contribute $3 now to help us reach our =
goal by midnight tonight?

Secretary Clinton is going to a New York City fundraiser today with =
financial elites. Help us match her fundraising numbers today by adding =
your contribution now.

Our campaign is showing the billionaire class that they can't have it all. =
That no longer can they buy our elections and our democracy.

We're building our effort in a different way, and I think that we can send =
a very strong message if we hit our goal of raising $1 million today.

Please chip in $3 now to help us reach our goal by midnight tonight:

I wanted to send you a short note letting you know that tomorrow is the =
last chance to make a contribution to our campaign and have it go towards =
Saturday's Nevada caucus.

We were down 23 points in Nevada just a month and a half ago. Today, we've =
cut the lead to a few points, but recently learned the Clinton campaign is =
now outspending us in the state. Your contribution today will help us =
close the gap and could mean the difference between a miraculous victory =
or close defeat. Contribute here:

https://go.berniesanders.com/nevada

With the caucus Saturday, South Carolina's primary next weekend and Super =
Tuesday in less than two weeks, we're asking all of Bernie's supporters to =
make a contribution before tomorrow night. If everyone does, there will be =
no stopping our political revolution.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers -

When we started our campaign, we were down 37 points in Nevada. We had no =
money and no organization. No one gave us a chance. It was supposed to be =
part of the "Clinton Firewall" in case we did well in Iowa and New =
Hampshire (which we did).

Now, look at this -- what could be the final public poll before Saturday's =
Nevada caucus.

CNN - Nevada Caucus (February 17, 2016)
Clinton: 48%
Sanders: 47%

It's SO CLOSE. And if we win in Nevada, we have a chance to create a real =
domino effect that swings a number of Super Tuesday states in our favor. =
We can all see the path to victory -- let's bring it home:

Your $3 contribution to Bernie's campaign, right now, could mean the =
difference between victory and defeat in Nevada, and for our political =
revolution in the Democratic primary:

https://go.berniesanders.com/lets-win-nevada

Here's the truth: the political and financial establishment in this =
country are TERRIFIED of our success. That's why the Clinton campaign has =
ramped up their high-dollar fundraising efforts to unprecedented levels -- =
holding an average of more than one event per day recently! Can you =
imagine? It's just staggering...

But Bernie doesn't go around begging millionaires and billionaires for =
money. And that's part of the reason we are doing so well on this =
campaign. Not only have people had more than ENOUGH of the influence of =
the billionaire class on our democracy, but because of your continued =
support, Bernie can stay on the campaign trail talking to voters.

Your $3 contribution today will help deliver victory in Nevada, which we =
believe will swing a number of Super Tuesday states in our favor. Make it =
here:

https://go.berniesanders.com/lets-win-nevada

We've said from the start that we are building the kind of campaign that =
has the power to win the Democratic primary, the White House, and take =
back our country back from the billionaire class. People should not =
underestimate us.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers -

This campaign has been so successful because it's powered by working =
people. The financial and political elite of this country aren't driving =
our effort and they certainly aren't calling the shots.

That has our opponents panicked, and on the eve of the Nevada caucus they =
have taken to lashing out. Not just at Bernie, but at you.

* Bill Clinton compared supporters powering our political revolution -- =
people like you -- to the Tea Party. The Tea Party!

* A Clinton superdelegate expressed outrage that people who might actually =
be voting for the first time dare to challenge the selection of the =
Democratic Party's elite.

* One of the pro-Clinton super PACs has now dumped over $1 million into =
the Democratic Primary process -- even though they said this Wall Street =
and big donor cash was only to be used against the Republicans.

That's fine. While they are throwing stones, we're going to keep our eyes =
on the prize: winning the Democratic primary, the White House, and take =
our country back from the billionaire class. And next up is Nevada, where =
one poll shows we trail by JUST ONE POINT with two days to go. Today is =
your last chance to contribute to put us over the top:

Your $3 contribution to Bernie's campaign, right now, could mean the =
difference between victory and defeat in Nevada, and for our political =
revolution in the Democratic primary.

https://go.berniesanders.com/lets_win_nevada

Through our campaign, we have brought millions of new people into the =
political process, and that is something we're very proud of -- everyone =
should be. It's good for Democrats, and it's good for democracy.

Combatting political alienation, cynicism, and legitimate anger in this =
country will not be easy. But if we are to re-invigorate American =
democracy, if the American middle class is going to stand up and fight =
back, this is the struggle that, together, we must undertake.

That is what we are doing on this campaign. And Nevada is the next step. =
That is why your contribution before midnight tonight is so important. =
Make it today:

Nobody can defeat the billionaire class by himself or herself. We can only =
do it together and united.

	This campaign has been so successful because it&rsquo;s powered by =

the shots.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">

Republicans.</li>

	That&rsquo;s fine. While they are throwing stones, we&rsquo;re going to =
keep our eyes on the prize: winning the Democratic primary, the White =
House, and taking our country back from the billionaire class. <strong>And =
next up is Nevada, where a recent poll shows we trail by JUST ONE =

	Combating political alienation, cynicism, and legitimate anger in this =

back, this is the struggle that we must undertake together.</p>

Hillary Clinton challenged Bernie to release the transcripts of his Wall =
Street speeches, and in turn she would reveal what she was paid to say to =
Goldman Sachs and other financial interests and big corporations.

So, OK. Bernie accepts Hillary Clinton's challenge. We will release the =
transcripts of all his Wall Street speeches. Right here. In this email.

Bernie's never been paid to speak to Wall Street.

Now it's Hillary Clinton's turn. Goldman Sachs paid her $675,000 for three =
speeches, and in total she made more than $21 million speaking to groups =
including Wall Street firms and big corporations.

It's important for voters to know what Hillary Clinton told to these Wall =
Street firms. We hope she will keep her word. Maybe you can nudge her to =
do the right thing, as well.

Add your name to say you want Hillary Clinton to release the transcripts =
of her Wall Street speeches:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/wall-street-speeches

We know very little about what Hillary Clinton has said to Wall Street =
firms behind closed doors. But it's critical that voters find out.

You can't challenge a corrupt system by taking its money. Hillary Clinton =
disagrees. The transcripts from her many Wall Street speeches should help =
clear up this disagreement.

Sisters and Brothers -

The final results are in from Nevada and it looks like we're going to =
leave another state with roughly the same number of delegates as Hillary =
Clinton, maybe down just a few.

I want to be completely clear with you about what this result means: =
Nevada was supposed to be a state "tailor made" for the Clinton campaign, =
and a place she once led by almost 40 points. But today, we sent a message =
that will stun the political and financial establishment of this country: =
our campaign can win anywhere.

There are 26 primaries and caucuses in the next month, and three straight =
positive results for our campaign are sure to prompt an over-the-top =
response from the millionaires and billionaires who are funding our =
opponent and her many super PACs.

We have to be prepared for their best shot, because it's coming:

Make a $3 contribution to our campaign tonight and we are going to win =
this Democratic primary, the White House, and take our country back from =
the billionaire class:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/nevada-results

We're closing the gap dramatically in states that have yet to vote, and =
there's a path to victory for our political revolution. If we continue to =
stand together, we'll continue to win.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

We should be very proud of what we accomplished today in Nevada. Just last =
month, the Clinton campaign said they were leading by 25 points in their =
internal polls. We'll leave Nevada just a few delegates behind. That's =
huge momentum.

The wind is at our backs. And in the next month, there are 26 primaries =
and caucuses.

Our campaign is funded by more than 4 million individual contributions -- =
a tremendous number of working Americans giving small amounts of money to =
take on a campaign and super PACs funded by millionaires, billionaires, =
hedge funds, and Wall Street.

Your $3 contribution right now will help send a message that you're =
standing with Bernie, and that you can help him win:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/nevada-results

Bernie said from the beginning that people should not underestimate us. =
That is true now more than ever.

Thank you for standing with Bernie.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

<a href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">last =

One of the consequences of the Supreme Court's disastrous decision in =
Citizens United is a flow of unlimited cash to super PACs from =
millionaires, billionaires, and even corporations.

These super PACs can take in as much money as they want, free from =
campaign finance limits adhered to by candidates.

We don't have a super PAC, and we don't want one. The Clinton campaign has =
several. When this campaign began, those Clinton super PACs were supposed =
to stay on the sidelines during the primaries. That is no longer the case.

Clinton super PACs are now spending millions of dollars to fight our =
movement. I don't think that's right. We should have a fight for the =
Democratic nomination fair and square. So we're turning to you again to =
help us even the scales against this super PAC spending.

Make a $3 contribution now to help Bernie and our campaign compete against =
our opponents' super PACs so we can win the Democratic nomination and the =
White House:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/super-pac-spending

We are now tied for delegates elected by voters, 51 to 51. But now that =
millionaires and billionaires' super PACs are heavily involved in this =
race, we will need to really step up our efforts to talk to voters and =
help our campaign win.

Thank you for all you've done. Let's keep going.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers -

After a virtual tie in Iowa, a huge win in New Hampshire, and a close loss =
in Nevada, here's where Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders stand in the =
pledged delegates that will choose the Democratic nominee...

We're tied! Hillary and Bernie have 51 pledged delegates a piece.

Not many people would have expected the race to be this tight. There are =
26 more caucuses and primaries in the next three weeks, including South =
Carolina this Saturday and eleven states on Super Tuesday.

Momentum is on our side, and with your help, we can break this tie to win =
the Democratic nomination and the White House.

Make a $3 contribution to Bernie right now to send a message that our =
movement has what it takes to win. People should not underestimate us:

Sisters and Brothers -

We are in the midst of a stretch where 27 states will vote or caucus as =
part of the Democratic primary, with over 2,000 delegates up for grabs. =
It's no exaggeration to say this is the most important stretch of our =
campaign.

Secretary Clinton's supporters are responding: her campaign is holding at =
least a dozen high-dollar fundraisers this week, including one last night =
where some donors paid $27,000 to attend. And one of her Wall =
Street-funded super PACs has spent millions of dollars to influence a =
number of the upcoming primaries.

They're responding this way because we have pulled within a few points in =
the national polls and ended up winning the Latino vote in Nevada. If we =
can keep it up, we are going to win. But we can't stop. Not now. Not when =
we are so close and with so much on the line. That's why I need to ask all =
of my supporters today:

Can I count on you to contribute $3 to our political revolution? =
Supporters like you are stepping up in record numbers, and if you add your =
contribution today, we are going to win this election:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/moving-forward-together

Yes, Wall Street has enormous economic and political power. Yes, Wall =
Street has made HUGE contributions to the Clinton campaign and their super =
PACs. Yes, they have an endless surplus of money.

But we have something they don't have. And that is millions of working =
families standing together and demanding change. If we keep moving forward =
together, we are going to win.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

There are some numbers I think are very important for you to know:

* 27 states and territories have their primaries and caucuses in the next =
several weeks, starting last weekend
* Last night, the Clinton campaign held a fundraiser where some =
high-dollar donors bundled $27,000
* The average contribution to our campaign is just $27

I think you know what I'm about to ask you to do.

Please contribute $27 to our political revolution so we can show the =
billionaire class that they can't have it all.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/27-dollars

Some other very important numbers you should know about: the last month =
has been very good for our political revolution. Nearly 600,000 people =
have contributed to our campaign since we came to a virtual tie in Iowa. =
Half of them did so for the very first time.

The polls are tightening. We're bringing in new voters - and contributors =
- to the political process. And we have a very good chance to win the =
Democratic nomination and the White House.

This is only possible because millions of people like you are stepping up =
to be a part of our movement. But we can't stop now.

Make a contribution of $27 - the average donation to our campaign - before =
a critical week of voting begins on Saturday:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/27-dollars

Thank you.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

Given the state of the Republican presidential race, it's time to =
acknowledge a very uncomfortable truth: Donald Trump is probably going to =
be the Republican nominee.

The question for Democrats is simple. Who has the best chance to defeat =
Trump? And by any objective measure, the answer is Bernie Sanders. In =
almost every recent head-to-head poll against Trump, Bernie leads by a =
wide margin while Hillary Clinton either trails or is within the margin of =
error. Take a look at these recent polling averages:

Huffington Post Average of Recent Polls
Sanders: 51% to Trump: 41%
Clinton: 48% to Trump: 44%

We have momentum, we have one less pledged delegate than Hillary Clinton, =
and we're closing the gap in the national polls. But with 26 primaries and =
caucuses in the next three weeks, Bernie needs you now:

Contribute $3 to our campaign today. It could mean the difference between =
victory and defeat -- between taking back our country from the billionaire =
class, or President Donald Trump:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/taking-on-trump

The truth is, it's going to take more than establishment politics and =
establishment thinking to beat Donald Trump.

But together, we are building something unprecedented. That is why we're =
doing so well in the polls, and why we've seen grassroots enthusiasm =
unmatched by any candidate on either side of this primary. Only Trump =
comes close. And that is why what we are building is what will be required =
to defeat him.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers -

It's been an amazing month for our political revolution. In the 24 hours =
after we won New Hampshire, more than 200,000 people contributed to our =
campaign. More than 100,000 donated in the days following the Iowa caucus, =
and the same since Nevada.

Our supporters are stepping up in record numbers, and that's why we've =
pulled within single digits nationally with less than a week to go before =
Super Tuesday. Three polls even show us with a slight lead.

But the most important stretch of our campaign is right in front of us: 26 =
primaries and caucuses over the next three weeks, with more than 2,000 =
delegates at stake. It could be a make-or-break moment for our campaign, =
and that's why we have to ask you directly:

Can Bernie count on you to make a $3 contribution to our campaign today? =
How supporters like you respond today could be the difference between =
victory or defeat for our political revolution:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/most-important-stretch

We're coming up on our final official FEC deadline before Super Tuesday, =
and we have a chance to report numbers that will shock the political and =
financial elite of this country. It's not just about the amount of money =
we raise, but how many contributions we report. Add yours to our growing =
total today.

Sisters and Brothers -

One of the ways you can get a sense of our momentum and the nervousness =
within the Clinton campaign is by seeing that they are now using massive =
amounts of super PAC money, funded largely by Wall Street, against our =
campaign.

One of those super PACs raised $15 million from Wall Street and the =
financial industry in the last half of 2015, and is now spending millions =
of dollars to try and tip the balance of a number of upcoming primaries =
and caucuses in Hillary Clinton's favor. And just yesterday alone they =
reported spending nearly another $500,000.

I don't have a super PAC, and I won't go around asking millionaires and =
billionaires for money. I am humbled that this campaign is funded by more =
than 4 million contributions made by working people who have had ENOUGH of =
the billionaire class buying our candidates and elections.

But I am here to tell you that if we are going to win this primary and the =
White House, we're going to have to stand together against the influence =
of Hillary Clinton's super PACs in this race.

Contribute $3 to our campaign to help us win on Super Tuesday and as a way =
of saying you have had ENOUGH of the billionaire class buying our =
candidates and elections:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-momentum

What is happening in these final days before Super Tuesday is that in =
state after state, the gap is narrowing or we are now forging ahead. Three =
recent national polls actually show us in the lead. The reason we have so =
much momentum, and the reason we are doing so well, is because people know =
that Washington is too busy representing the interests of wealthy campaign =
contributors to worry about the middle class.

We are going to change that through this campaign, and through our =
political revolution.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

Just days before the Iowa caucus, Hillary Clinton left the campaign trail =
for a high-dollar fundraiser at a hedge fund. That same hedge fund is a =
major investor in fracking, an incredibly destructive practice of =
extracting natural gas by pumping hundreds of secret chemicals into the =
ground.

Hillary Clinton supports fracking. I do not.

And just as I believe you can't take on Wall Street while taking their =
money, I don't believe you can take on climate change effectively while =
taking money from those who would profit off the destruction of the =
planet.

Please contribute $3 to our campaign right now to help elect a president =
who isn't beholden to special interests that profit off of pollution:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-planet

Dick Cheney pushed through changes to the Safe Drinking Water Act that =
legalized fracking, despite the fact that fracking companies keep the =
chemicals they pump into the ground a secret.

People who live near fracking locations no longer have drinkable water, =
and in some cases their tap water is actually flammable. Oklahoma has even =
seen a rash of earthquakes that many believe are a result of fracking.

In short, fracking is a disaster for the planet.

We need a president who is not beholden to special interests and who will =
do everything in his or her power to fight the effects of climate change. =
It's clear that to elect that kind of president, millions of people need =
to come together and chip in whatever they can.

Make a $3 contribution to our campaign now to send a message that you want =
to elect a president who will do everything possible to fight climate =
change:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-planet

We can't afford to let people who would destroy our planet elect our next =
president.

Thank you for your support.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

With just four days to go until Super Tuesday, Wall Street and the =
political establishment have made stopping our campaign their top =
priority.

But what they don't understand is that in this election, their obscene =
wealth and political power is not a strength -- it is their weakness.

And that is because the American people are sick and tired of the =
billionaire class of this country buying our elections. This year, people =
want something different. And if we stand together and continue to fight, =
we're going to give it to them on Super Tuesday.

Make a $3 contribution directly to Bernie 2016 today and we are going to =
do VERY well next week, we're gonna win this primary, and then win the =
White House in November:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/todays-goal

We've set a one-day goal of 50,000 individual contributions to our =
campaign. If we can reach that number, not only will we have the resources =
to win on Super Tuesday and beyond, but we'll send a powerful message to =
the next set of billionaires trying to buy this election that their =
participation only makes our political revolution stronger.

In solidarity,

Bernie Supporters -

There's no denying this: we're in the most important stretch of the =
campaign. With 26 primaries and caucuses in the next three weeks, there =
are almost enough delegates at stake to decide the whole election.

We can't let up. Not now. Not when we're this close.

Bernie doesn't have a super PAC. He doesn't have any millionaires or =
billionaires who'll step in. But Bernie has you.

So to show our strength to the billionaire class, we made a goal of our =
supporters making 50,000 individual contributions all in one day. Can =
Bernie count on you to hit our goal today? We're still short right now.

Make a $3 contribution right now to help us reach our goal of 50,000 =
individual contributions today:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/50k-contributions

We can do this. I know we can. Thanks for joining us to make it happen.

In solidarity,

When I first decided to run for president, my greatest fear was that if I =
were to run a poor campaign or did not do well, that it would be a setback =
not just for me, but for the ideas driving our campaign.

A lot of people said we had no chance. Our ideas are too big. The =
billionaire class is too powerful.

But we kept at it. We came to a virtual tie in Iowa, had a big win in New =
Hampshire, and made huge progress in Nevada.

What you're doing is working. Every contribution, every phone call and =
every door knocked is bringing our political revolution one step closer to =
winning the White House.

Now there's another big deadline, and it's Monday night: the final FEC =
reporting deadline before Super Tuesday. It's a huge opportunity to show =
the strength of our movement.

Please make a $2.70 contribution to our campaign and send an unmistakable =
message that you have had ENOUGH of the corrupt billionaire class buying =
our candidates and elections:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/an-unmistakable-message

There are twenty-six primaries and caucuses over the next three weeks, =
with thousands of delegates at stake. We're up against a billionaire class =
that doesn't want us to succeed, and they're willing to do anything it =
takes to stop our movement.

I'm so glad to have you at our side, sisters and brothers.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

At the bottom of our website and every email we've sent since the start of =
this campaign it says "Paid for by Bernie 2016." And beneath those words, =
"(not the billionaires)."

That's because when we started this campaign we were polling at 3 percent, =
we had no organization, no money, and we were taking on the most powerful =
political organization in the United States.

Then a supporter from Chicago, Illinois made the first contribution to our =
campaign -- for $3. A few minutes later, $50 from a supporter in =
California, then $10 from someone in Georgia. Ten months and four million =
contributions later, working people have powered our political revolution =
further than anyone could have imagined.

But tomorrow we face one of our most important tests of the campaign: the =
final FEC fundraising deadline before Super Tuesday.

Make a $2.70 contribution to our campaign before tomorrow's critical =
deadline and we'll have the resources we need to win this primary, the =
White House, and take back our country from the billionaire class.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/not-the-billionaires

Super Tuesday is in just two days. Then there are twelve more primaries =
and caucuses in the two weeks that follow -- a few in VERY LARGE, =
delegate-rich states. And Hillary Clinton's billionaire-funded super PAC =
is already spending obscene amounts of money.

This campaign is powered by people like you, "not the billionaires." =
That's why your contribution before tomorrow's deadline is so important.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

Sisters and Brothers - There are two ways to run a campaign in a =
post-Citizens United world.

The first is one that many politicians know well: courting millionaires =
and billionaires for very big checks, constantly holding big fundraising =
events, and ending up beholden to your donors. This method now also means =
being OK with super PACs.

The other way is quite different, and honestly, much more difficult. But =
it's the path we chose, and we believe it's the right path.

No super PACs. No billionaire class waiting to step in and save us. What =
we have is millions of people willing to stand together and say ENOUGH is =
ENOUGH. Our movement has made more than 4 million individual contributions =
to this effort, at an average of about $27 apiece.

Tomorrow night's FEC fundraising deadline might be the biggest yet of our =
campaign. If you can, we need you to stand with Bernie.

Make a $2.70 contribution to Bernie 2016 before Monday night's deadline:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/not-the-billionaires

You are a part of something that is unprecedented. We're so glad to have =
you at our side.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers -

Today is one of the most important days of our campaign: the final FEC =
fundraising deadline before Super Tuesday. Let me tell you why this =
matters.

Eleven states vote tomorrow, and twelve more vote over the next two weeks. =
It is the most important stretch of our campaign. And what today's =
deadline will tell us is whether or not working people coming together and =
contributing small amounts of money can compete with the millionaires and =
billionaires bankrolling Hillary Clinton's campaign and her largest super =
PACs.

So I have a wild idea: I want to challenge you to help our campaign hit a =
goal that will absolutely astonish the political and financial =
establishment of this country. It's a bit of a stretch, but it's within =
the spirit of this campaign to accomplish what everyone else thinks is =
impossible. So here it goes:

Make a $2.70 contribution to our campaign and help us hit our goal of =
raising $40 million in February before tonight's critical FEC fundraising =
deadline:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-goal

We started today having raised $36,105,613 in February from more than 1.2 =
million individual contributions. I have no idea if we can reach our goal =
by midnight. But if we do, it will not only send an unmistakable message =
about the size and strength of our movement -- it will also ensure we have =
the resources to win this Democratic primary. That's why your $2.70 =
contribution before midnight is so important.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

Here is the truth at the heart of this campaign: we will never be able to =
change a corrupt political system by taking its money.

Hillary Clinton receives a tremendous amount of money from Wall Street. =
This morning, Christine from Brookline, Massachusetts contributed $3 to =
our political revolution because she's had enough of billionaires buying =
elections. Health care and pharmaceutical companies have contributed =
millions of dollars to the Clinton campaigns. Thomas, a laid-off welder =
from Ohio with no health care contributed a few bucks because he believes =
in Bernie.

On the surface it might not seem like a fair fight, but when people come =
together anything is possible. And the response since Bernie's challenge =
to help our campaign raise $40 million in the month of February has been =
incredible. These are all real contributions from people helping us reach =
our goal. Add yours before our midnight FEC fundraising deadline:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-goal

With Super Tuesday tomorrow, we are entering the most important stretch of =
this campaign. Our opponent's largest super PAC has really stepped up =
their spending after receiving more than $15 million in Wall Street money =
during their final fundraising report of 2015.

But what we are going to demonstrate in this election is that their =
enormous wealth and power is their weakness. When we hit our goal tonight, =
we are going to send a powerful message to those who have yet to vote that =
we have what it takes to defeat the billionaire class in this election. =
That's why we have to ask:

Can Bernie count on you to make a $2.70 contribution for the final FEC =
fundraising deadline before Super Tuesday? You can do that here:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-goal

Every single contribution we receive before midnight should be seen as a =
declaration of support for the values we share. People should not =
underestimate us.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

Sisters and Brothers -

We're more than halfway through the final day of our critical fundraising =
deadline, but we're still short of hitting our ambitious goal. Will we =
make it? That's up to you.

But let me tell you this: Bernie Sanders doesn't go around asking for =
contributions from millionaires and billionaires. If we're going to reach =
our goal and have the resources we need to win on Super Tuesday and in the =
dozen primaries and caucuses over the following weeks, it's going to come =
from working people coming together to give what they can in small =
amounts.

That's how this campaign is funded, and it happens largely in response to =
emails like this one. That's why I have to ask directly: Can Bernie count =
on you to contribute $2.70 before midnight tonight? You can do that here:

https://go.berniesanders.com/our-goal

Ninety-six percent of the pledged delegates are still up for grabs in this =
primary, with many of them awarded over the next month. That's why this =
goal is so important. If everyone who has signed up to support Bernie =
contributes today, we're going to have what we need to win.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

Sisters and Brothers -

What we have accomplished together today is something no one could have =
never imagined in their wildest dreams. Not only did we meet our goal of =
$40 million raised in the month of February -- without asking a single =
millionaire or billionaire for money -- but we have a chance to reach an =
updated goal of $45 million.

Will we get there? It will be really difficult, and I am not sure it's =
possible. But if anyone can put us over the top, it's you.

Can I count on you to add your $2.70 contribution before midnight?

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-goal

Not only would hitting our goal shock the political establishment of this =
country, it would ensure we have the resources to complete in the most =
important stretch of the campaign over the next two weeks.=20

Sisters and Brothers -

The polls just closed and we have earned our first victory of the night in =
Vermont.

It looks like the margin should be impressive as well. That means a lot of =
delegates for our campaign, which is very important. I think we are going =
to do quite well tonight.

As you watch the results, we've already started preparing for what's next: =
twelve VERY important primaries and caucuses over the next two weeks. But =
we have to be prepared to fight, organize, and win against anything the =
financial and political establishment are going to throw at us. That's why =
I have to ask you:

Can you make a $2.70 contribution to our campaign tonight? We're doing =
very well so far, but your donation could mean the difference between =
victory or defeat in the states that come next:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/super_tuesday

No candidate for president can do it alone, and I want you to know that =
any success we enjoy tonight and in the states to come is because of the =
millions of working people who have come together through our campaign to =
say that we have had ENOUGH of the billionaire class buying our candidates =
and elections.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

We did very well tonight, sisters and brothers. It's all thanks to you.

We started off the night winning Vermont, then we won Oklahoma, and we =
just got word we won Colorado too. Minnesota is looking really good in the =
early returns as well.

No one thought we would get this far. You proved them wrong. Working =
people are coming together and voting for Bernie in states across the =
country. They are contributing small amounts of money so we can compete =
with the millionaires and billionaires bankrolling Hillary Clinton's =
campaign and her largest super PACs.

Contribute $2.70 to our campaign tonight and we'll have the resources to =
continue our momentum into the twelve primaries and caucuses happening =
over the next two weeks:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-next-victory

Our campaign needs to be prepared for whatever comes next. I can assure =
you that our opponent's billionaires and lobbyists will do everything they =
can to stop our campaign in the twelve caucuses or primaries in the next =
two weeks.

You should be extraordinarily proud of what we accomplished tonight ... =
and we're just getting started. People should not underestimate us.

Sisters and Brothers -

Last night, voters in Colorado, Oklahoma, and Minnesota joined the people =
of Vermont and New Hampshire in showing America that a political =
revolution is spreading across our country.

One of the reasons I believe we are doing so well is because people know =
that this campaign is about more than electing a president - it is about =
transforming America. It's about making our country the great nation we =
know it has the potential to be. It is about dealing with some unpleasant =
truths, and having the guts to confront those truths.

Now, Wall Street and the super PACs may be against us; they have already =
spent outrageous sums of money to stop our progress. But what we are =
proving on our campaign is that when people stand together, anything is =
possible.

If we are going to win this primary and take our country back from the =
billionaire class, we have to be ready to fight, organize, and win in the =
states ahead. So I have to ask you today:

Your $2.70 contribution to our campaign strikes a blow against a corrupt =
campaign finance system and ensures we'll have the resources we need to =
win this Democratic primary:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/transforming-america

Fifteen states have voted, 35 remain. And let me assure you that we are =
going to take our fight for economic justice, for social justice, for =
environmental sanity, and for a world of peace to every one of those =
states. And we are going to win.

People should not underestimate us.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

This is what we're up against, sisters and brothers: last month, the =
Clinton campaign held almost sixty fundraising events. They've often held =
these events with hedge fund managers, fracking interests, pharmaceutical =
executives, and other industries with business before the government.

Meanwhile, their Wall Street-funded super PAC spent ridiculous amounts of =
money to tip the balance in their favor in super Tuesday states, and the =
trend continues in a number of contests happening over the next two weeks.

But what the billionaire class has yet to realize is that in this =
election, their obscene wealth is their weakness. Part of the reason we =
are doing so well and exceeded expectations last night is because the =
American people have had ENOUGH of a corrupt campaign finance system being =
used to buy our candidates and elections.

Our campaign is funded almost exclusively by 4.8 million individual =
contributions made by people like you. So we've set an important new goal: =
reaching 5 million individual contributions by the time Michigan votes in =
six days.

Make a $2.70 contribution to our campaign and help us reach 5 million =
individual contributions by the time Michigan votes in six days:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/5-million

When it comes to taking on Donald Trump in November, one thing is clear: =
Democrats, Independents, and Republicans alike are sick of the influence =
of big money in politics. We cannot afford to give Trump the upper-hand on =
this issue. It could be decisive.

In solidarity,

"The great challenge that we face is whether the United States will become =
a vibrant democracy with a strong middle class or whether we slide into an =
oligarchy in which the economic and political life of the country is =
controlled by a handful of billionaire families." - Bernie Sanders

Sisters and brothers, we are extraordinarily proud of the way we've funded =
this campaign: more than 4.8 million individual contributions from working =
people giving small amounts of money. But we have 12 important primaries =
and caucuses in the next two weeks, and we've set an important goal that I =
have to ask you to help us meet:

Contribute $2.70 and help us reach 5 million individual contributions by =
Sunday night's important debate in Michigan. If we get there, Bernie will =
tell the national audience from the debate stage:

https://go.berniesanders.com/5-million

In this country we have a political system in which a handful of very =
wealthy people use their obscene wealth to buy politicians and elections.

Many politicians in both parties are happy to take grotesque sums of money =
from billionaires who bankrupted the economy and who profit from the =
destruction of our environment, the outsourcing of jobs, and the high =
price of drugs that are killing Americans.

Not Bernie. He doesn't go around asking millionaires and billionaires for =
money. Our campaign doesn't have a super PAC. This campaign is powered by =
millions of people coming together to transform a nation.

Help us reach 5 million individual contributions by Sunday night's debate. =
You can do that here:

https://go.berniesanders.com/5-million

Bernie doesn't represent large corporations and he doesn't want their =
money. Throughout American history, nothing significant happens in terms =
of social change unless a strong grassroots movement takes place. That's =
what we're building through our political revolution.

Right before Bernie gets on stage at 8 p.m. Sunday night for the =
Democratic debate in Flint, Michigan, I want to be able to tell him that =
our campaign passed an incredible milestone: 5 million individual =
contributions.

So many people have stepped up since we announced our new goal. We have =
4,901,844 contributions right now, which is incredible. I know Bernie =
would love to be able to tell the country about meeting our goal Sunday =
night, but right now we might fall short.

Make a $2.70 contribution to our campaign right now and we can meet our =
goal before Bernie takes the stage for Sunday's debate.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/five-million

We can do this if we stand together. I'm going to give Bernie an update =
tomorrow morning on our progress and will report back with what he says.

Thank you for being a part of this.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

I'll be direct, sisters and brothers: we're in an intense stretch of the =
campaign where success for Bernie means the political and media =
establishment must take note.

Kansas, Louisiana, and Nebraska all vote or caucus today. Maine caucuses =
tomorrow, and then at 8 p.m. Sunday Bernie takes the stage for the next =
Democratic debate in Michigan, where voters go to the polls on Tuesday.

I think we will do very well in the next couple days. It's going to be =
intense, and I know Bernie would love to know that you're with him.

Make a $2.70 contribution to our campaign to send a message to the =
establishment that Bernie's on the path to winning the Democratic =
nomination and the White House.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/three-states

I told Bernie how close we are to our goal of 5 million individual =
contributions to our campaign, and I know he's looking forward to telling =
the country we met our goal at Sunday's debate. Thanks for standing with =
Bernie.

In solidarity,

We just won again, sisters and brothers -- this time in Kansas!

Tonight's victory means the last three states called in this Democratic =
primary have been won by our political revolution. And we're optimistic =
that we'll do well in the caucus already underway in Nebraska, and another =
in Maine tomorrow.

This all sets up for Michigan on Tuesday night, where we're optimistic we =
can get the number of delegates needed to keep us on track for victory. =
But that starts with us hitting our critical goal before tomorrow night's =
debate in Flint.

Contribute $2.70 to our campaign and help us reach 5 million individual =
contributions before tomorrow night's debate. We're so close that your =
donation could be the one that puts us over the top:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/another-victory

When we started this campaign, no one would have ever expected we'd win =
this caucus. But then Carrie, a self-employed daycare owner from Shawnee, =
Kansas, joined our campaign the day we announced. A bookkeeper from =
Wichita added his name and $50 contribution shortly after. A photographer =
from Overland Park joined the political revolution and chipped in $10 =
minutes later.

Ten months later, we've earned our sixth victory of the race, far more =
than anyone would have expected. We're on track to win the Democratic =
nomination, but it will only happen if we continue to stand together like =
our supporters in Kansas did today.

Contribute $2.70 to our campaign today:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/another-victory

Never in my wildest dreams would I have ever imagined that we'd receive =
over 5 million individual contributions to our campaign. I am humbled and =
thankful for your support.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

I have two very important updates for you today.

The first is that we won Nebraska last night, in addition to winning =
Kansas. That makes seven wins for Bernie, and we have a chance of doing =
well when Maine caucuses today.

The second is that we are so very close to hitting our goal of 5 million =
individual contributions before tonight's Democratic debate in Flint, =
Michigan. But we need a few thousand more in order to make it so Bernie =
can tell the country during tonight's debate.

Please make a contribution of $10 to Bernie 2016 today so we can reach our =
goal of 5 million individual contributions before tonight's debate:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-won-nebraska

Today will be a very big day for our campaign. Thank you for being a part =
of it.

In solidarity,

Team Bernie - At 8pm ET tonight, Bernie will step on the stage in Flint =
for the final debate before Tuesday's election in Michigan.

Sometime during the debate, we'll know the results from today's caucus in =
Maine. We hope to do well there.

And if we all pull together, Bernie will be able to tell the world we =
reached 5 million individual contributions to our campaign.

Before the end of tonight's debate, please make a $3 contribution to our =
campaign to tell the world you stand with Bernie:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lets-reach-5-million

This will be a huge night for Bernie and our campaign. Thanks for being a =
part of it.

Sisters and Brothers -

While many in our country's political and financial establishment would =
love to see our campaign go away, tonight proved once again that we are =
well on our way towards winning this Democratic primary.

We were declared the winner of the Maine caucus during the debate -- our =
3rd victory out of 4 states this weekend -- and we reached 5 million =
individual contributions shortly before I stepped on stage.

Tonight's debate highlighted a number of important differences between =
Hillary Clinton and myself, most notably on the issue of the disastrous =
trade agreements costing American jobs.

But we are now we are entering the most important stretch of this =
campaign, starting on Tuesday when Michigan votes. The billionaire class =
in this country is spending obscene amounts of money to try and stop us, =
but if we continue standing together, we're going to win:

Your $3 contribution ensures we'll have the resources to win, and it sends =
a powerful message that you have had ENOUGH of the billionaire class =
buying our elections:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-won-maine

If we can do well in Michigan and again during next Tuesday's primaries, =
the map shifts dramatically in our favor. From that point forward, we =
expect to win the delegates we need to capture the Democratic Party's =
nomination. But that plan only works if we continue to stand together =
against the special interest money funding the Clinton campaign and super =
PACs.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">
	While many in our country&rsquo;s political and financial establishment =
would love to see our campaign go away, <a href=3D"#" =
style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">tonight</a> proved once =
again that we are well on our way towards winning this Democratic =
primary.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">
	<strong>We were declared the winner of the Maine caucus during the debate =
&mdash; our 3rd victory out of 4 states <a href=3D"#" =
style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">this weekend</a> &mdash; =
and we reached 5 million individual contributions shortly before I stepped =
on stage.</strong></p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">
	<a href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: =
#364350;">Tonight&rsquo;s</a> debate highlighted a number of important =
differences between Hillary Clinton and myself, most notably on the issue =
of the disastrous trade agreements costing American jobs.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">
	But we are now we are entering the most important stretch of this =
campaign, starting on <a href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: =
#364350;">Tuesday</a> when Michigan votes. The billionaire class in this =
country is spending obscene amounts of money to try and stop us, but if we =
continue standing together, we&rsquo;re going to win:</p>

buying our elections.</strong></a></p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">
	If we can do well in Michigan and again during next <a href=3D"#" =
style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">Tuesday&rsquo;s</a> =
primaries, the map shifts dramatically in our favor. From that point =
forward, we expect to win the delegates we need to capture the Democratic =
Party&rsquo;s nomination. But that plan only works if we continue to stand =
together against the special interest money funding the Clinton campaign =
and super PACs.</p>

Sisters and Brothers -

Earlier today, Michigan State University released their final poll before =
tomorrow's primary, and I wanted to make sure you saw these results:

Michigan State University Poll - Michigan (March 7, 2016)
Hillary Clinton 52%
Bernie Sanders 47%

Last night's debate quite clearly laid out some of the differences in this =
primary: one candidate has opposed free trade deals that cost American =
jobs. One candidate supported the auto bailout and opposed the bank =
bailout. And one candidate believes we cannot change Wall Street's =
behavior by taking their money. That candidate is Bernie Sanders.

We were down over 20 points in Michigan in some polls as late as last =
week. Help power Bernie past the finish line today:

Your $3 contribution to Bernie's campaign will help us close the gap in =
Michigan and win a number of large and important primaries one week from =
tomorrow:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/michigan-poll

Our campaign is the best chance to take our country back from the =
billionaire class in this election. But the next two weeks will go a long =
way towards deciding whether we get that chance.

I believe if we stand together, we're going to win. And that's why your =
contribution is so important.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

Sisters and Brothers -

Last night, Secretary Clinton said she was ready for this primary to be =
over, and if you listen to some of our friends in the political =
establishment and corporate media, it sounds like they're ready for the =
same.

Well, let me remind you of how many times they've told us our path was too =
difficult: in Iowa, they said it when we were down almost 50 points. And =
again when we were down 44 in New Hampshire, 28 in Colorado, and double =
digits in Minnesota.

Today begins the most important seven-day stretch of our campaign: =
tonight, Michigan votes. Next week, Illinois, Ohio, Florida, Missouri, and =
North Carolina follow suit.

If we continue to stand together and fight, what we are going to do in =
this next week is what we've done throughout this entire campaign: we are =
going to share our message with the American people, and we are going to =
shock the establishment. That is why I have to ask you directly:

Can I count on you to make a $3 contribution to our campaign before the =
polls close in Michigan tonight? It could be the difference in the coming =
elections:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our_democracy

I want you to imagine a world eight years from now where nobody who works =
40 hours a week lives in poverty, health care is a right for all =
Americans, kids of all backgrounds can go to college without crushing =
debt, there is no bank too big to fail, no banker too powerful to jail, =
and we've reclaimed our democracy from the billionaire class.

That is what our campaign is about, and why it is so important we keep =
fighting. Because if we do, we are going to win. That is why your =
contribution before the polls close tonight is so important.

Add your $3 contribution to our political revolution today and we will =
fight and win in the states ahead:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our_democracy

Real change comes about when large numbers of ordinary Americans speak, =
vote and get involved in the democratic process. If we stand together, we =
win. If we are divided, the big-money interests win.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers - Something amazing is happening in the state of =
Michigan. With more than 70% of the vote in, the race is too close to call =
-- but we're in the lead. And no matter what happens, this is a great =
night for our political revolution.

Very few people in the establishment thought this was possible. One poll =
this week had us losing the state by 25 points. But now it looks like we =
could win.

Every time the establishment underestimates us. And every time, we come =
back and show them they're wrong. Let's keep doing it.

Contribute $3 to our campaign now and show the establishment that we can =
win the Democratic nomination and the White House:

I'm proud to have you with me.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

The results are in and we were just declared the winner in a very =
important state for our campaign: Michigan. That's a major, game-changing =
victory for our campaign.

The corporate media counted us out. The pollsters said we were way behind. =
The Clinton super PACs spent millions against us across the country. We =
were hit with a dishonest attack in the debate. But we won, again... and =
if we continue to stand together, we can win this nomination.

One week from today, five large and delegate-rich states vote. Time and =
time again, your support has enabled us to overcome large deficits and =
emerge victorious. But you can expect the political establishment to come =
after us even harder now. The super PACs are going to spend even more. We =
have to be prepared to fight back.

Make a $3 contribution to our campaign right now, and we're going to keep =
winning states so that we can win this Democratic primary:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-won-michigan

Millions of people have come out to vote for our political revolution. =
They have donated more than 5 million times to our campaign. And together, =
we are sending a message to the oligarchy that we are not to be =
underestimated.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

By the time the polls closed in Michigan last night, the corporate media =
had written us off. The political establishment was trying to get us out =
of the race, and the Clinton campaign was eager to "wrap up" the primary =
as soon as possible.

But the people of Michigan had other ideas. Last night our political =
revolution scored "one of the greatest upsets in modern political =
history," and we're seeing the same kind of come-from-behind momentum all =
across America.

Next Tuesday is the most important night for our campaign to date. Five =
large states vote, and we have all the momentum. And what we've shown is =
that when we come together, we have what it takes to overcome what was =
once thought to be an inevitable campaign.

The financial and political elite of this country are going to throw =
everything they have at us this week. The stakes are too high for them. I =
need your support if we're going to be able to fight back and win.

Contribute $3 to our campaign today and we are going to win this =
Democratic primary, the White House, and take back our country from the =
billionaire class:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/next-5-states

This is going to be a long, hard fight. And we've only done as well as we =
have because millions of people have come together to say they've had =
ENOUGH of the billionaire class buying elections in this country.

If we continue to fight, and if you contribute, we are going to win.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Friend -

How did you feel when you saw the news last night?

CNN calls Bernie Sanders as the winner of Michigan

Five states vote next Tuesday, and you can expect the Clinton campaign and =
its super PACs to throw the kitchen sink at us. It's coming.

We've already received close to 100,000 contributions since the polls =
closed last night, and if you add a $3 contribution to that total right =
now, we're going to very, very well next week:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/next-5-states

This is the most important stretch of our campaign to date. How we respond =
in this week could mean the difference between victory and defeat for our =
political revolution.

In solidarity,

We like to set big goals in this campaign, sisters and brothers. It's in =
our spirit. We reach for something that many say is impossible -- that =
most people say will never happen.

And then, every time, millions of us come together and prove the =
establishment wrong.

So we're doing that again with a new fundraising goal: by midnight =
tonight, raising $5 million since the polls closed in Michigan.

Contribute $3 to our campaign now and help us reach this goal by midnight =
to show our momentum after the huge win in Michigan:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/5-million-michigan

We stunned the media and political establishments last night with our =
game-changing win in Michigan.

Reaching our goal of raising $5 million for Bernie coming out of this =
victory would stun them again. So let's show the establishment what we're =
made of.

Make a $3 contribution to Bernie 2016 and help us reach our goal by =
midnight:

"And I am proud that the gentleman who is head of Goldman Sachs, now he =
didn't give me $225,000 for speaking fees. He said I was dangerous. And he =
is right, I am dangerous for Wall Street." - Bernie Sanders at tonight's =
debate

Are you watching tonight's debate? It's almost over and Bernie is doing =
VERY WELL to build on the momentum from last night's historic victory in =
Michigan.

But we are still short of hitting our goal of $5 million raised since the =
polls closed in Michigan last night. Add your $3 contribution to our =
campaign before midnight tonight, and we'll get there:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/5-million-debate

Five very important, delegate-rich states vote next Tuesday. This is the =
most important week of our campaign. The super PACs who are trying to tip =
the balance for Hillary Clinton are going to give us everything they've =
got. It's coming ... and we have to be prepared to fight, respond and win.

Add your $3 contribution before midnight tonight, and we're going to do =
very, very well next Tuesday night:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/5-million-debate

What we are proving on this campaign is that when people come together, =
anything is possible.

"But [Bernie Sanders] is still out raising us by large margins, and if =
that continues, we could see more results like we saw in Michigan last =
night." - Hillary Clinton's message to the donors who finance the majority =
of her campaign

Sisters and Brothers -

Here's the truth: one of the reasons we are doing so well in this campaign =
is because Bernie supporters - like you - are stepping up every day, in =
unprecedented and historic numbers.

So Hillary Clinton's message to her donors is right: if you contribute =
this week, before the five very important primaries next Tuesday, we're =
going to see more victories like the one in Michigan earlier this week ... =
and we're going to win this nomination.

As you go, we go.

Make a $3 contribution to our campaign and we're going to keep winning =
elections, the Democratic primary, White House, and take our country back =
from the billionaire class:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/the-nomination

We are moving up in the polls in the March 15th states, but we still have =
more ground to cover. Yet what we have proven time and time again is that =
our campaign finishes strong and wins. But that will only happen if =
supporters like you keep stepping up. That's why your contribution is so =
important.

I think it's very important that you read what The Washington Post wrote =
yesterday about Hillary Clinton's distortions:

But it's striking that, as Clinton has doubled down on the attacks, she =
has with some regularity played pretty fast and loose with the facts.

She'll take a vote Sanders has made during his 25 years in Congress and =
gloss over most, if not all, of the details about it. The result is a =
carefully worded insinuation or even outright accusation that Sanders has =
voted against his base on everything from immigration to the auto bailout =
to fossil fuels.

All this week in the press and Wednesday night on the debate stage, Bernie =
has had to defend himself against mud-slinging and distortions about his =
record and our campaign. That doesn't even count the super PACs funded by =
Wall Street and a billionaire class determined to see us lose.

Bernie's running a positive campaign. He doesn't have a super PAC. We are =
only doing so well because our supporters have contributed more than 5 =
million times to help Bernie win.

So I need to ask you directly one more time: please make a $3 contribution =
to our campaign now to help Bernie defend against our opponent's attacks:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/clinton-distortions

Five big states will vote on Tuesday - Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North =
Carolina, and Ohio. We're doing everything we can to correct the record =
about the attacks on Bernie and turn out the millions of voters we need to =
win.

Your contribution will be so important for Bernie doing well on Tuesday. =
We'll put it to use immediately to talk to voters in every state. This is =
how we'll win.

Rush your $3 contribution to Bernie now:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/clinton-distortions

Thank you for being a part of this.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers -

We always expected the millionaires and billionaires backing the Clinton =
campaign would throw the kitchen sink at us ahead of this Tuesday's five =
big primaries.

Here it comes.

Just yesterday, the Clinton campaign's largest super PAC spent hundreds of =
thousands of dollars in Missouri, Illinois, and Ohio. And there's more =
coming. That brings the total spent supporting Hillary Clinton's campaign =
to more than $10 million from this group alone!

There are only four days before the critical elections on Tuesday, and =
we're approaching the last chance for you to contribute and have it go =
towards the upcoming primaries. Bernie needs you today:

Make a $3 contribution to our campaign and send a message that you have =
had ENOUGH of the billionaire class trying to buy this election:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/super-pacs-spending

Five large, delegate-rich states in just four days. We're down a bit in =
each of them, but like we proved in Michigan, if people step up and come =
together in support of our campaign in the days before these primaries, =
there's nothing we cannot accomplish.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

Here we come!

Fort Hays St. University 3/11 - (MO)=09
Clinton: 47%=09
Sanders: 40%=09

Quinnipiac 3/8 (Ohio)
Clinton: 52%
Sanders: 43%

At this point last week, we were down more than 20 points in Michigan. But =
we scored the greatest upset in modern political history because our =
supporters stepped up in record numbers in the final days before the =
primary.

Once upon a time we were down 20, 30 points or more in ALL FIVE STATES =
voting next Tuesday. Not any more. We're rapidly closing the gap =
everywhere, and if supporters like you are able to chip in today, we're =
going to do very, very well again. Today is one of the last days to give =
and have it make a difference:

Contribute $3 to our campaign today and we're going to keep closing the =
gap. Five big states vote in just THREE DAYS. Your contribution could be =
the difference between victory and defeat:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mo-oh-polls

Tuesday is probably the single most important day of our campaign so far. =
If we are able to do well, the map shifts in favor, as there are a lot of =
states set to vote where we already have the lead. If we do well Tuesday, =
we have a very good chance of winning this primary. But in order for that =
to happen, we need you to contribute (again) today.

is probably the single most important day of our campaign so far. If we =
are able to do well, the map shifts in favor, as there are a lot of states =

Sisters and Brothers -

In just about 72 hours, we'll be watching the results come in from North =
Carolina, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Missouri.

We've come so far -- too far to come up short now.

Because when we win against the most inevitable candidate in decades, =
every single campaign after ours will be forced to think twice before =
accepting big checks from Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry, and =
people who profit from destroying our environment.

And when that happens, we can start to break free of a corrupt political =
system that results in Wall Street regulating Washington, D.C., and not =
the other way around.

Those are the stakes on Tuesday night and in this primary. And I know that =
if we stand together, we are going to do very, very well.

Contribute $3 to our campaign today and we're gonna win the delegates we =
need to win on Tuesday night, we're gonna win this primary, and then the =
White House in November:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/tuesdays-contests

We are closer in a number of the states voting on Tuesday than we were at =
this point before our historic victory in Michigan. But time is running =
out for you to contribute to help put us over the top.

That's why your donation matters so much, and why I have to ask you to =
make one before it's too late.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

Sisters and Brothers -

I want you to think back over the last five weeks. I want you to remember =
how it felt when we won New Hampshire. Then how it felt when we won four =
states on Super Tuesday, and then three more the week after.

And of course, think about how you felt when we staged the greatest =
comeback in political history when we won Michigan.

Now let's do it again this Tuesday.

Success in Tuesday's huge elections in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North =
Carolina, and Ohio will be possible only if everyone who supports our =
campaign joins together again. We're up against super PACs and the =
billionaire class, and the only way we do well is when our supporters =
stand together.

Please chip in $3 to our campaign now and get ready to shock the political =
establishment on Tuesday:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/when-millions-stand-together

What we are doing together is only possible because millions of people =
decided that enough was enough. And if we continue to stand together, =
anything is possible.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Here's the truth. In less than 48 hours, the polls open in five large and =
delegate-rich states. These are the most important two days of our =
campaign.

We need to do well on Tuesday because after that the map shifts =
dramatically in our favor. With every vote cast after Tuesday, Hillary =
Clinton's lead will only shrink until we overtake her campaign, probably =
sometime in early June. But it all comes back to these next 48 hours, and =
we still have work to do.

We've set a goal of 150,000 individual contributions before tomorrow at =
midnight. If we can reach that mark, we'll have what we need to do well on =
Tuesday and expand our lead in the states that follow. Please add your =
contribution and help us hit that goal. You can do that here:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/path-to-the-nomination

We are on the verge of shocking the political, financial, and media elite =
of this country. And it is all because millions of people stood up to say =
the same old establishment ideas won't work. It's time for change. It's =
time for a political revolution.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers -

We just received the latest poll out of Illinois, the second largest state =
voting on Tuesday, and wanted to share it with you immediately:

NBC News - Illinois - 3/13
Hillary Clinton: 51%
Bernie Sanders: 45%

We have come so far in a short time. The most recent polls here showed our =
campaign down 19, 42, and 37 points. It would be heartbreaking to come up =
short after everything we've overcome together so far. Don't let that =
happen, especially not with the millionaires and billionaires ramping up =
their spending to stop us.

Make a $3 contribution today to help us reach our goal of 150,000 =
contributions by tomorrow at midnight. If we hit that mark, we're going to =
do very, very well on Tuesday night:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/path-to-the-nomination

We are so so so close.

If every single person who has signed up to join our campaign made a =
contribution today, we would be absolutely unstoppable on Tuesday night =
and in the states that follow.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

In about 48 hours, several million more Americans will have cast their =
votes for who they want to be their nominee for president.

But I don't want to cross my fingers watching votes come in Tuesday night. =
I want to know that our team did everything in our power to help Bernie =
win before the polls close.

What we've done together is historic. We've built a movement that is =
challenging the political, financial, and media establishment - and =
winning. Don't stop now.

Help us do everything in our power to win big on Tuesday. Make a $3 =
contribution to our campaign now:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/path-to-the-nomination

After last week's historic comeback in Michigan, a big win on Tuesday =
night in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio would =
absolutely stun the establishment. They wouldn't know what to do.

But we can only do this if we do it together. Let's show 'em what we've =
got.

Chip in $3 and help us go all out for Tuesday's big primaries:

"I am writing to inform you that I will be a candidate for President of =
the United States. I ask for your support."

Sisters and Brothers -

Those were the first words I used to launch our campaign almost 11 months =
ago. In that same announcement, I also wondered if it may already be too =
late to stop the billionaire class and the forces of greed from buying the =
presidency.

But what we have proved since that day is that it is not too late. Through =
our campaign, we have started to turn back the assault on the foundations =
of our democracy and our future. But tomorrow is probably the single most =
important day for our campaign since we started.

We've set a goal of reaching 150,000 individual contributions from =
yesterday morning to midnight tonight. Right now, we're more than halfway =
there. So I have to ask directly:

Can I count on you to make a $3 contribution before our midnight deadline? =
Reaching our goal could be the difference between victory and defeat in =
the Democratic primary:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-moment-of-truth

We are now, as we were when we started this campaign, at a moment of =
truth. We need to face up to the reality of where we are as a nation, and =
the same old establishment ideas will no longer be enough.

I believe America is ready for a new path to the future. And tomorrow =
night's results will go a long way toward determining if we'll get that =
chance. That's why your $3 contribution is so important:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-moment-of-truth

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

Let me tell you, Bernie is going after every. last. vote. today. Before =
midnight, he'll hold five rallies in four of the states with a primary =
tomorrow: Ohio, North Carolina, Missouri, and Illinois.

He's working so hard because we are so damn close. This morning, a fresh =
wave of polls came out showing Bernie leading or within the margin of =
error in three of those states. And in the fourth, we're well within the =
margin of some of Michigan's polling in the final days.

Bernie's doing everything he can today, and that's why he's asking you to =
do the same. He doesn't go around asking millionaires for money - our =
campaign is funded by emails like this. So we have to ask:

Can Bernie count on you to make a $3 contribution before midnight tonight? =
We're almost at our goal of 150,000 contributions before our midnight =
deadline. Put us over the top:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-moment-of-truth

After tomorrow night, the map shifts dramatically in our favor. And I mean =
dramatically. If we can do well tomorrow night, we're going to win. Those =
are the stakes. And that's why hitting our goal is so important.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers -

This is the final round of polling before five states vote tomorrow that =
we told you about earlier today. I gotta tell you, this is about as close =
as it can be for us to do well in these three states.

OHIO
Clinton 46%, Sanders 41%

ILLINOIS
Clinton 48%, Sanders 45%

MISSOURI
Sanders 47%, Clinton 46%

I'll say it again: It's just so. damn. close.

And there's one thing that we can all do when it's this close. Let's reach =
for our goal of 150,000 contributions by midnight tonight and show Bernie =
we have his back.

Chip in $3 to our campaign now before these five big states vote on =
Tuesday. Let's give Bernie all we've got:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-moment-of-truth

With Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, Florida, and North Carolina all voting =
tomorrow, the results from these races mean we have a chance to keep up =
our momentum.

I know Bernie's glad to have you with him. I am too.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers -

When I decided to run for president, I had to decide: should I start a =
super PAC and travel the country begging millionaires and billionaires to =
contribute to my campaign? It took me about a tenth of a second to decide =
against that.

Instead, we chose a different path, and it's very moving to me that our =
campaign has received more than 5 million individual contributions from =
working people and the middle class who want us to transform this country =
in significant ways.

So that's why I send these emails, because it is how we're able to run a =
campaign that is not beholden to Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry, =
and those who profit from the destruction of the planet. And it's why I =
have to ask directly -- one more time -- ahead of the most important day =
of the campaign to date:

Can I count on you to contribute $3 to our campaign to help us hit our =
goal of 150,000 individual contributions before midnight? We're very =
close, and yours could be the one that puts us over:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-moment-of-truth

This campaign is about a grassroots movement of Americans standing up and =
saying: "Enough is enough. This country and our government belong to all =
of us, not just a handful of billionaires."

Every single contribution we receive not only amplifies that message, but =
helps ensure we'll have the resources we need to win.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Team Bernie -

I told you about the polls where we're so damn close -- down only by =
single digits in Ohio and Illinois and up by one in Missouri. We're also =
doing better in polls in Florida and North Carolina than we were before we =
won in Michigan.

But let me tell you where else we're so damn close: getting to 150,000 =
contributions made to our campaign from yesterday until midnight tonight.

Our campaign is only doing so well because - more than 5 million times - =
people like you have made a contribution to support Bernie. The money we =
raise to power our movement comes from you and you alone.

No super PACs. No millionaires or billionaires. Just you and our political =
revolution.

Contribute $3 to our campaign now and help us reach our goal of 150,000 =
new contributions by midnight tonight:

Thank you for standing with Bernie.

When we started our campaign 10 months ago, I don't think you could find a =
single person who would believe you if you said Bernie Sanders would win =
nine states by this point in the campaign.

Last night we beat all the polls in almost every state. We earned a =
significant number of delegates, and are on track for the nomination. =
Here's why:

What you will not hear from the political and media establishment is that, =
based on the primary and caucus schedule for the rest of the race, this is =
the high water mark for the Clinton campaign. Starting today, the map now =
shifts dramatically in our favor.

Arizona, Idaho, and Utah are up next Tuesday. Alaska, Hawaii, and =
Washington State caucus the Saturday after. Then it's Wisconsin's turn to =
vote.

That means we have an extremely good chance to win nearly every state that =
votes in the next month. If we continue to stand together, we're just =
getting started for our political revolution:

Make a $3 contribution to our campaign and we can win this Democratic =
primary, the White House, and take our country back from the billionaire =
class:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/what-comes-next

No one said a political revolution would be easy. We are up against a =
billionaire class and super PACs that are determined to see us lose.

The fact remains that Hillary Clinton's lead will never be as large as it =
is right now. From here on out we keep chipping away until we take the =
lead. But that can only happen if we keep fighting, and that's why your $3 =
contribution to our campaign is so important:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/what-comes-next

The whole country will be watching to see how we respond in this moment. =
Let's send a message that millions of Americans are just as ready to fight =
for an economy that works for everyone as we were when this campaign =
started 10 months ago.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

For decades, Bernie Sanders has fought for us:

For health care as a right for every man, woman and child. For an economy =
that works for all Americans, not just a handful of wealthy elites. And to =
stop a slide toward oligarchy where the political life of our country is =
controlled by a handful of billionaire families.

And if one thing is clear after last night's results, it's that you're =
ready to keep fighting for him.

More than 27,315 contributions have come into our campaign since the polls =
closed last night, and if you add yours before midnight, we're going to =
send a clear message to the corporate media and political establishment =
that we're just getting started.

Can Bernie count on you to add a $3 contribution to our campaign before =
midnight tonight?

>From here on out, the map shifts in our favor. We're going to do very well =
next Tuesday, and the states immediately following look just as good. If =
we stand together, if we keep fighting, we can win.

All my best,

Jeff Weaver

I have three very important facts for you to know today.

- There are 27 primaries and caucuses between now and June 7, which is the =
day we expect to overtake Hillary Clinton's campaign in pledged delegates =
needed to win the nomination.

- In the next 7 days, the Clinton campaign is hosting 7 fundraisers where =
some high-dollar donors will bundle at least $27,000 each.

- The average contribution to our campaign is just $27.

I think you know what I'm about to ask you to do.

Please contribute $27 to our political revolution so we can win the =
Democratic nomination, the White House, and take our country back from the =
billionaire class:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/twenty-seven-dollars

As Bernie wrote to you earlier, it's important to know that today is the =
high water mark for the Clinton campaign. The primaries and caucuses ahead =
of us represent big chances for us to win. Starting today, the map now =
shifts dramatically in our favor.

Arizona, Idaho, and Utah are up next Tuesday. Alaska, Hawaii, and =
Washington State caucus the Saturday after. Then it's Wisconsin's turn to =
vote.

We think we have a great shot at winning every single state that votes in =
the next month. But we can only be that successful if you're still with us =
tonight.

Make a $27 contribution to our campaign now and show the billionaire class =
that they can't have it all:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/twenty-seven-dollars

Your support for Bernie now means that we can keep fighting for our =
political revolution. Thank you for being a part of this.

In solidarity,

No one ever said a political revolution would be easy.

But we must remember that the struggle for our rights is not the struggle =
of a day, or a year, or a generation. It is the struggle of a lifetime, =
and one that must be fought each and every generation. Today, it is our =
turn to fight.

The billionaire class and political establishment in this country would =
like very much for us to go away. They see our proposals and the way we =
fund our campaign as a threat to their existence and have been determined =
to see us lose from day one.

But the response from supporters across the country has made one thing =
clear: we aren't going anywhere -- we are going to win.

Since the polls opened on Tuesday, we have received more than 100,000 =
contributions and raised almost $3 million dollars. So we've set a goal =
that will give us the resources we need to win all three primaries and =
caucuses next Tuesday:

Make a $3 contribution to our campaign and help us raise $5 million in =
online small-dollar contributions from working Americans by midnight =
tonight:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-5m-goal

We are less than halfway through this Democratic primary and expect to do =
very well in the states to come. There are a lot of delegates left to be =
won: four states alone hold more delegates than Secretary Clinton has in =
total today.

Are we underdogs? For sure. But we have been underdogs from the beginning =
of this campaign. And the people powering our campaign, the people working =
longer and longer hours for lower wages, the sick without health care, and =
the students staring at the prospect of crushing debt, are underdogs as =
well.

But if we continue to stand together, we are going to keep chipping away =
at Hillary Clinton's lead until we overtake her on June 7th.

That's why I have to ask you directly:

Can I count on you to make a $3 contribution to our campaign and help us =
raise $5 million in online small-dollar contributions from working =
Americans by midnight tonight?

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-5m-goal

The economic and political systems of this country are stacked against =
ordinary Americans. But we are fighting back through our campaign, and we =
can win.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">

<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">
	The billionaire class and political establishment in this country would =
like very much for us to go away. They see our proposals and the way we =

to see us lose from day one.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">
	But the response from supporters across the country has made one thing =
clear: we aren&rsquo;t going anywhere &mdash; we are going to win.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">
	Since the polls opened on <a href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; =

contributions and raised almost $3 million dollars. So we&rsquo;ve set a =
goal that will give us the resources we need to win all three primaries =
and caucuses <a href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: =

<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">
	We are less than halfway through this Democratic primary and expect to do =
very well in the states to come. There are a lot of delegates left to be =
won: four states alone hold more delegates than Secretary Clinton has in =
total <a href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: =

<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">

of this campaign. And the people powering our campaign, the people working =
longer and longer hours for lower wages, the sick without health care, and =
the students staring at the prospect of crushing debt, are underdogs as =
well.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">

Sisters and Brothers

Here is what Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are doing today:

Hillary Clinton is attending a fundraiser in Tennessee, a state that =
already voted, to collect checks from high-dollar donors who are bundling =
as much as $27,000.

Bernie Sanders is holding a town hall with voters in Arizona to talk about =
the issues that matter.

What about tomorrow?

Hillary Clinton is attending a fundraiser in Virginia, another state that =
already voted, to collect more checks from high-dollar donors who are also =
bundling as much as $27,000.

Bernie Sanders is holding three rallies with voters, one in each of the =
states that vote or caucus on Tuesday -- Idaho, Utah, and Arizona.

This is only possible because YOU are Bernie's donors. No millionaires or =
billionaires to bundle money from their rich friends. Just you, .

That's why we set a goal of raising $5 million by the end of the day =
today. So long as you're with us, Bernie can keep talking to voters to =
build our political revolution.

Contribute  $3 to our campaign, and we can win every state that votes in =
the next month and win the Democratic nomination.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-5m-goal

When we send these emails, it's because only through donations from you is =
Bernie able to do the hard work necessary to talk to voters and win.

And when voters hear Bernie's message in town halls and rallies, they come =
to his side -- and stay there.

You are our advantage. You are the reason Bernie has done so well against =
the political establishment and its super PACs. And you are the way that =
Bernie can win.

That's why I have to ask you directly:

Rush your  $3 contribution to Bernie now and help us reach our goal of $5 =
million raised between Tuesday and midnight tonight.

Thanks for standing with Bernie.

Sisters and Brothers -

>From the beginning, ours has been a campaign of big ideas and big goals.

After Tuesday night, the political establishment and corporate media all =
wondered how we'd respond. So we set another big goal, one most thought =
would be unattainable.

We said that we would try to raise $5 million in individual, small-dollar =
contributions from the time the polls opened until midnight tonight. Time =
is running out, but we are close enough to reaching that number if you add =
your $3 contribution right away:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-5m-goal

Reaching this $5 million goal will ensure we have the resources we need to =
win next Tuesday's primaries and caucuses in Arizona, Idaho, and Utah. And =
if we do that, we'll be one step closer to the ultimate goal: winning this =
Democratic primary.

The second half of the primary starts now, and it's one where we hold a =
considerable number of advantages. If we can keep winning states and =
delegates, we're going to come back and win this primary. That's why your =
$3 contribution before midnight is so important:

Sisters and Brothers -

I want to tell you about something that encapsulates so much of what is =
wrong with our economy, our government, and our corrupt political system. =
Then I'm going to ask for your help to stop it.

Pfizer is a giant pharmaceutical company based in New York City that has a =
history of overcharging Americans for prescription drugs. It's in the =
process of trying to merge with another company located in Ireland.

If the merger is successful, Pfizer would technically become a foreign =
company, meaning it could dodge around $35 BILLION in corporate taxes here =
in America.

Enough is enough. Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies cannot be =
allowed to evade taxes and rip off American patients who already pay the =
highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.

I sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew asking him to prevent =
Pfizer from taking many of the steps it wants in order to avoid paying =
taxes in America. Can you add your name to say you want Pfizer to pay the =
taxes it owes?

ADD YOUR NAME =C2=BB =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/pfizer-must-pay-taxes

What Pfizer is trying to do is known as a "corporate inversion." In this =
case, Pfizer, an American company, is merging with a company based abroad. =
The result of the merger is a company with an address in another country - =
even though the majority of shareholders are still based in America.

Pfizer apparently doesn't want to pay the $35 billion in taxes it would =
owe in America. I don't think that's right.

No matter what, you can bet that Pfizer would continue to overcharge =
Americans for prescription drugs, too. Since 2014, the pharmaceutical =
company has hiked the prices of seven of its top selling drugs by an =
average of 39 percent.

Pfizer also charges 12 times as much in the U.S. under Medicare for these =
drugs as it charges in Ireland, where it's claiming a new address for tax =
purposes.

All of this is the result of years of weakened tax laws, an abdication of =
responsibility by American companies to their country, and a corrupt =
political system that allows it to happen.

And I believe we can stop it.

Add your name and together we can stop Pfizer's corporate tax dodge and =
take a big step forward for our political revolution;

Dear Bernie Supporter -

At every turn, the establishment pundits have written us off, shut us out, =
and tried to write our movement's obituary.

We shouldn't be surprised that, once again, they're piling on to say game =
over. But, with more than 50 percent of the delegates still up for grabs, =
we're just at half time.

Here's the truth: there has never been a campaign better positioned for =
the long haul than this one, for two critical reasons:

1. Our grassroots, small-dollar fundraising machine powered by you, our =
supporters.

2. Our unprecedented voter contact machine powered by you, our volunteers.

Simply put, your donations are what allow us to keep the lights on and =
keep spreading Bernie's message - even when the corporate media =
sanctimoniously declares that it's time for us to call it quits - and your =
participation as volunteers is what's allowed us to win nine states so far =
and send shockwaves through the political establishment.

You've heard a lot about our historic number of small-dollar donors and =
donations, which is incredible. But what all of you have been doing as =
volunteers is no less extraordinary:

- Over 7,600 individual Bernie volunteers have hosted their own voter =
contact events calling voters and knocking on doors
- In the past week alone there were over 1,600 phone bank events held by =
Bernie volunteers
- Since January, Bernie volunteers have made over 38 million calls to =
voters in key states.

Nothing like this has ever happened before in American politics, with this =
many volunteers stepping up to do the heavy lifting. And it's working. In =
state after state, your calls and door knocks are what's moving the =
needle.

As we move into late March, we're entering a pivotal stage of the =
campaign. The primary calendar is shifting in our favor, with many states =
coming up where we can win - or win big. But to make up critical ground =
and take this all the way to November, we're going to need each and every =
one of you to volunteer if you haven't already, or double down and =
volunteer again if you're already involved.

You can help Bernie win by calling voters in the upcoming states from home =
using our dialer system, or by hosting a phonebank event to make a lot of =
calls with other Bernie supporters.

YES, I WILL MAKE CALLS FROM HOME:
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/phonebank/

YES, I'LL HOST A PHONEBANKING PARTY:
https://bernie16.cp.bsd.net/page/signup/host-a-phonebank-for-bernie?source=
=3Dem160319

Nothing worth fighting for will be easy. This campaign has always been a =
long shot, and it's indisputable that this past Tuesday our path to the =
nomination narrowed a bit.

But let's be clear about one thing: there is absolutely still a path to =
victory. And this movement - which has already reshaped American politics =
- is not about to give up, with 24 states still left to go.

The pundits can't stop our campaign. They couldn't stop it when they =
ignored us for months before Iowa and wrote us off as a protest campaign. =
And they can't stop us now. We're not giving up, and we know you won't =
either. There's too much at stake to leave this political revolution =
unfinished.

It's an honor to be with you in this movement.

In solidarity,

Claire Sandberg

<p style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	We shouldn't be surprised that, once again, they're piling on to say game =
over. But, with more than 50 percent of the delegates still up for grabs, =
we're just at half time.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	<strong>Here's the truth: there has never been a campaign better =
positioned for the long haul than this one, for two critical =
reasons:</strong></p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; line-height:140%; =
margin-left:30px;">
	1. Our grassroots, small-dollar fundraising machine powered by you, our =
supporters.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; line-height:140%; =
margin-left:30px;">
	2. Our unprecedented voter contact machine powered by you, our =
volunteers.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	Simply put, your donations are what allow us to keep the lights on and =
keep spreading Bernie's message &ndash; even when the corporate media =
sanctimoniously declares that it's time for us to call it quits &ndash; =
and your participation as volunteers is what's allowed us to win nine =
states so far and send shockwaves through the political establishment.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	You've heard a lot about our historic number of small-dollar donors and =
donations, which is incredible. But what all of you have been doing as =
volunteers is no less extraordinary:</p>
<blockquote style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; =
line-height:140%;">
	&bull; Over 7,600 individual Bernie volunteers have hosted their own =
voter contact events calling voters and knocking on doors.<br>
	&bull; In the past week alone there were over 1,600 phone bank events =
held by Bernie volunteers.<br>
	&bull; Since January, Bernie volunteers have made over 38 million calls =
to voters in key states.</blockquote>
<p style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	Nothing like this has ever happened before in American politics, with =
this many volunteers stepping up to do the heavy lifting. <strong>And it's =
working.</strong> In state after state, your calls and door knocks are =
what's moving the needle.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	As we move into late <a href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: =
#364350;">March</a>, we're entering a pivotal stage of the campaign. The =
primary calendar is shifting in our favor, with many states coming up =
where we can win &ndash; or win big. But to make up critical ground and =
take this all the way to <a href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; =
color: #364350;">November</a>, we're going to need each and every one of =
you to volunteer if you haven't already, or double down and volunteer =
again if you're already involved.</p>
<p style=3D"font-family:Arial; font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	<strong>You can help Bernie win by calling voters in the upcoming states =
from home using our dialer system, or by hosting a phonebank event to make =
a lot of calls with other Bernie supporters.</strong></p>

I wanted to make sure you saw Bernie's email yesterday about how we can =
stop the Big Pharma company Pfizer from dodging out on $35 BILLION in =
taxes it owes America. Please read Bernie's note below and add your name =
to help stop Pfizer from dodging $35 billion in taxes.

****Email from Senator Bernie Sanders:******

I want to tell you about something that encapsulates so much of what is =
wrong with our economy, our government, and our corrupt political system. =
Then I'm going to ask for your help to stop it.

Pfizer is a giant pharmaceutical company based in New York City that has a =
history of overcharging Americans for prescription drugs. It's in the =
process of trying to merge with another company located in Ireland.

If the merger is successful, Pfizer would technically become a foreign =
company, meaning it could dodge around $35 BILLION in corporate taxes here =
in America.

Enough is enough. Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies cannot be =
allowed to evade taxes and rip off American patients who already pay the =
highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.

I sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew asking him to prevent =
Pfizer from taking many of the steps it wants in order to avoid paying =
taxes in America. Can you add your name to say you want Pfizer to pay the =
taxes it owes?

ADD YOUR NAME =C2=BB =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/pfizer-must-pay-taxes

What Pfizer is trying to do is known as a "corporate inversion." In this =
case, Pfizer, an American company, is merging with a company based abroad. =
The result of the merger is a company with an address in another country - =
even though the majority of shareholders are still based in America.

Pfizer apparently doesn't want to pay the $35 billion in taxes it would =
owe in America. I don't think that's right.

No matter what, you can bet that Pfizer would continue to overcharge =
Americans for prescription drugs, too. Since 2014, the pharmaceutical =
company has hiked the prices of seven of its top selling drugs by an =
average of 39 percent.

Pfizer also charges 12 times as much in the U.S. under Medicare for these =
drugs as it charges in Ireland, where it's claiming a new address for tax =
purposes.

All of this is the result of years of weakened tax laws, an abdication of =
responsibility by American companies to their country, and a corrupt =
political system that allows it to happen.

And I believe we can stop it.

Add your name and together we can stop Pfizer's corporate tax dodge and =
take a big step forward for our political revolution;

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/pfizer-must-pay-taxes

Thank you for your support.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

	No matter what, you can bet that Pfizer would continue to overcharge =
Americans for prescription drugs, too. <a href=3D"#" =
style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">Since 2014</a>, the =
pharmaceutical company has hiked the prices of seven of its top selling =
drugs by an average of 39 percent.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">
	Pfizer also charges 12 times as much in the U.S. under Medicare for these =
drugs as it charges in Ireland, where it&rsquo;s claiming a new address =
for tax purposes.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">
	All of this is the result of years of weakened tax laws, an abdication of =
responsibility by American companies to their country, and a corrupt =
political system that allows it to happen.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">

Dear Sisters and Brothers,

The vast levels of income and wealth inequality that we are seeing today =
did not come down from the heavens -- they came about as a result of =
policy decisions that work against the interests of the American people. =
And together, we have the power to move our country in a different =
direction.

We can achieve health care as a right for all people. We can create decent =
paying jobs. And we can make sure that every person in this country gets =
the education they need and desire.

Despite what the corporate media and the political establishment might =
have you believe, these are not utopian ideas. But they won't happen =
unless we stand up and fight back.

This Tuesday, three more states will have their say in this presidential =
primary and we have the chance to do well in all of them. Let's show the =
political establishment that when we stand together, there is nothing we =
cannot accomplish.

Make a $3 contribution to our campaign today to say you are ready to stand =
up to the billionaire class and transform America:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/no-longer-fringe

Almost 11 months ago when I announced that I would run for president, the =
corporate media wrote me off as a "fringe candidate."

Well, I think the corporate media would agree that a lot has happened in =
the past 11 months. We have won nine states, and came very close in =
others. We have received more than 5.7 million individual contributions to =
our campaign from nearly 2 million people. And we have hundreds of =
thousands of volunteers across the country making calls and knocking on =
doors.

What we are doing is building a movement of people who are prepared to =
stand up and fight back against the status quo. The same old, same old =
establishment ideas are not enough. That is why I need you to join me in =
this effort before Arizona, Idaho, and Utah vote on Tuesday.

Add your $3 contribution now to send a message that this country belongs =
to all of us, and that it's past time our government started working for =
the people it is elected to serve:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/no-longer-fringe

The stakes in this election couldn't be any higher. Either we continue =
with the status quo, or we come together to shape a brighter future for =
our kids and our grandkids.

Thank you for your support, sisters and brothers. I have always said I =
cannot do this alone, and I'm glad to have you by my side.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

In less than a week, voters in Washington will head to caucus locations =
across the state to make their choice in the Democratic primary. So Bernie =
and Hillary Clinton are heading there on Tuesday for dueling events.

Bernie is speaking at an arena that holds more than 17,000 people, free of =
charge. Hillary Clinton is going with a more ... expensive event, one that =
costs as much as $50,000 in bundled fundraising to meet her at a private =
reception.

Here's the truth: Bernie doesn't go around begging millionaires and =
billionaires for campaign contributions because he believes you can't =
change a corrupt political system by taking its money. This campaign is =
funded by working Americans, and it's an important week for all of us.

Tomorrow we find out the results from Democrats Abroad where we should do =
well. Democrats in three states make their choices for the nominee on =
Tuesday, and Washington caucuses on Saturday. It's an important stretch, =
and that's why Bernie wants me to ask:

Contribute $3 to Bernie's campaign today and we're going to have a very, =
very good week, reclaim a number of delegates, and continue on our path =
toward the nomination:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-big-week-ahead

Late last week, Bernie drew an enormous crowd of 14,000 in Utah. Huge =
audiences have showed up to watch him speak at multiple events in Arizona, =
and he's spent considerable time in Idaho as well.

Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has taken a number of days off the campaign =
trail to raise money. When you contribute to emails like this one, it =
allows Bernie to spend his time doing what candidates for the highest =
office in the land should be doing: talking to voters. That's why your $3 =
contribution today is so important -- it gives us a real advantage in =
states where Bernie can spend a good amount of time:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-big-week-ahead

We've had this week marked on the calendar from the beginning of the =
campaign because this is when the map shifts dramatically in our favor. =
We're excited to share some big victories with you in the next few days, =
and if you continue to stand with Bernie, we can win this nomination.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

Sisters and Brothers -

Tomorrow night is a very important night for our campaign.

There's a primary in Arizona throughout the day and Utah and Idaho will =
caucus at night. We expect to do very well, and will hopefully take our =
first cut into Hillary Clinton's delegate lead by the time it's all said =
and done.

>From there, we have a very important caucus in Washington where we hope to =
walk away with a significant delegate advantage.

But yesterday afternoon we found out that Hillary Clinton and her super =
PAC raised almost $35 million in the month of February -- the overwhelming =
majority of that money coming in the form of high-dollar, direct =
contributions to the Clinton campaign.

We need to do very well this week, and that's why I need to ask:

Can Bernie count on you to contribute $3 to our campaign before midnight =
tonight? Arizona, Idaho, Utah, and Washington hang in the balance, and =
your donation could be the difference:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/before-tomorrows-contests

Bernie likes to say that when people stand together, anything is possible. =
In this campaign, our supporters -- giving small amounts of money -- are =
taking on Wall Street, pharmaceutical interests, and people who profit =
from the destruction of the planet.

And if we keep going, we can win this nomination.

All my best,

Something pretty wild happened when our campaign and the Clinton campaign =
filed FEC reports yesterday.

Yes, the overwhelming majority of money raised directly by the Clinton =
campaign in February came from big-dollar donations. Yes, a former hedge =
fund executive's family gave millions of dollars to her super PAC. These =
things are to be expected by now.

But what we never expected was that our supporters, a large number of =
working Americans giving small amounts of money at a time, raised more =
than the Clinton campaign. A lot more ... almost two times as much in =
direct contributions.

Now, the Clinton campaign has still raised more than us to date. But we =
are catching up. And when we do, that's going to make it easier for us to =
run the margins we need to gain the delegate lead on June 7th. But that =
will only happen if supporters like you keep stepping up.

Add your $3 contribution to our campaign by midnight tonight - ahead of =
our important primary and caucuses tomorrow night. It could make the =
difference:

Bernie likes to say that when people stand together, anything is possible. =
In this campaign, our supporters -- giving small amounts of money -- are =
taking on Wall Street, pharmaceutical interests, and people who profit =
from the destruction of the planet.

And we are winning. If we keep going, we can win this nomination.

This is a big deal, sisters and brothers. Yesterday afternoon, we received =
the final results from another Democratic primary contest:

Democrats Abroad Results - March 21, 2016
Sanders: 69% (nine delegates)
Clinton: 31% (four delegates)

Here's why this result is important: we netted more delegates from the =
Democrats Abroad voting than Hillary Clinton netted with her narrow =
victories in Illinois, Massachusetts, and Missouri combined.

This is the result we needed. Now we wait to hear from Arizona, Idaho, and =
Utah later tonight, where we should do well. But we also have to focus on =
what's next, and that is the CRITICAL caucus in Washington on Saturday.

Your $3 contribution today will ensure we have what we need to win =
Washington State's caucus this Saturday. We need a good margin there, and =
your contribution could make the difference:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-won-democrats-abroad

We've said all along that March 15th would be the high-water mark for =
Hillary Clinton's campaign. Now the map shifts in our favor, and we're =
going to begin clawing back delegates in state after state until we =
capture the lead on June 7th. But that will only happen if we continue to =
stand together.

Sisters and Brothers -

We just scored two more victories ... big ones, this time in Utah and =
Idaho.

Here's why this matters: we walked away from the three states that voted =
yesterday with a majority of the delegates. That's yuge. That's how we win =
the nomination.

We always knew last Tuesday was the high water mark for the Clinton =
campaign. Now it's our turn to start winning large majorities in many of =
the remaining states until we take the pledged delegate lead on June 7.

Now we all need to start thinking about what's next: the 142 delegates at =
stake in Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii this Saturday.

Make a $3 contribution to our campaign today and we're going to cut into =
Hillary Clinton's lead even further with a significant number of delegates =
in Washington this weekend:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/idaho-and-utah

Bernie drew a huge crowd in Boise, Idaho on Monday and another 14,000 =
people to a rally Salt Lake City, Utah last week. And last night we found =
out that we are actually leading in a general election poll against Donald =
Trump in Utah.

It isn't often that a Democratic candidate for president has a chance to =
carry Utah, but our political revolution is attracting significant support =
from Democrats, Independents, and even some Republicans. That's part of =
the reason we're the best chance for Democrats to retain the White House, =
and to enact transformational change after the election.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">
	We just scored two more victories &hellip; big ones, this time in Utah =
and Idaho.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">
	Here&rsquo;s why this matters: <strong>we walked away from the three =
states that voted yesterday with a majority of the delegates.</strong> =
That's yuge. That's how we win the nomination.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">
	We always knew <a href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: =
#364350;">last Tuesday</a> was the high water mark for the Clinton =
campaign. <strong>Now it&rsquo;s our turn to start winning large =
majorities in many of the remaining states</strong> until we take the =
pledged delegate lead on <a href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; =
color: #364350;">June 7.</a></p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">
	Now we all need to start thinking about what&rsquo;s next: the 142 =
delegates at stake in Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii <a href=3D"#" =
style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">this Saturday.</a></p>

<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">
	Bernie drew a huge crowd in Boise, Idaho <a href=3D"#" =
style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">on Monday</a> and another =
14,000 people to a rally in Salt Lake City, Utah <a href=3D"#" =

href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">last night</a> =
we found out that we are actually leading in a general election poll =
against Donald Trump in Utah.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%; font-family:Arial;">
	It isn&rsquo;t often that a Democratic candidate for president has a =
chance to carry Utah, but our political revolution is attracting =
significant support from Democrats, Independents, and even some =
Republicans. That&rsquo;s part of the reason we&rsquo;re the best chance =
for Democrats to retain the White House, and to enact transformational =
change after the election.</p>

We need to talk about the importance of Saturday, sisters and brothers.

Washington (101 delegates) -- Hawaii (25 delegates) -- Alaska (16 =
delegates)

We have a chance to do very well in these states. In Washington alone, the =
largest of the states voting this weekend, 35,000 people have showed up at =
just three of the last rallies for Bernie. And when you pair our potential =
for success with our victories on Monday and Tuesday, we could cut into =
Hillary Clinton's delegate lead by more than 15 percent by the end of the =
week.

But we simply must do well this weekend, and that's why we have to ask:

Contribute $3 to our campaign today and we can win the delegates we need =
to continue on our path toward victory in the Democratic primary. Your =
contribution today could be the difference for an additional delegate this =
weekend:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-path-to-victory

We are still underdogs in this campaign, as we have been from the start. =
But so are many of the working families who have given so much of =
themselves in support of our campaign. No one ever said taking on the =
political, financial, and media establishment in this country would be =
easy, but if we continue to stand together, we can win.

Sisters and Brothers -

What happened yesterday in Arizona should be considered a national =
disgrace. I got an email last night from a woman who waited five hours to =
vote in Arizona. Five hours.

We don't know how many thousands of people didn't get to cast their =
ballots yesterday in Arizona because they couldn't afford to wait that =
long. Scenes on cable news last night showed hundreds of people in line at =
11:30pm in Phoenix - more than four hours after polls closed. Voting =
should not be this difficult.

One reason it is so hard to vote in Arizona is because the Supreme Court =
gutted the Voting Rights Act. There were 70 percent fewer polling places =
this year than in 2012 in Phoenix's county. They wouldn't have been =
allowed to cut those polling places if the Voting Rights Act was still in =
tact.

These cuts meant that, in a county with more than 4 million residents, =
there were just 60 polling places. This is unacceptable, but it's also not =
an isolated incident.

We need to make it easier to vote, not more difficult. One way we can do =
that is by reaffirming our support for the Voting Rights Act, which, when =
I am president, I will fight to reinstate.

Add your name to say you support reinstating the Voting Rights Act so we =
can make voting easier for everybody, not more difficult.

ADD YOUR NAME =C2=BB =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/reinstate-voting-rights-act

We cannot continue to see democracy undermined in the United States of =
America. Enough is enough.

Make no mistake: the billionaire class does not want Americans to vote. =
Billions of dollars are being funneled into our elections in a form of =
legalized bribery, even as American voters -- especially minority voters =
-- are being discouraged from voting. It is no wonder that government no =
longer works for ordinary Americans.

Above all, we need to remember the price that was paid for the right to =
vote. The Voting Rights Act was one of the great victories of the civil =
rights movement. Now, as then, change comes when the people demand it -- =
in the voting booth, and on the streets in peaceful demonstrations. We =
must remind ourselves of what's been achieved in the past, and resolve to =
do equally great things in the future. Democracy is not a spectator sport.

It is my sincere hope that the states that vote in the coming weeks and =
months do better than what we saw yesterday in Arizona. Too much is at =
stake for our future.

Right now, what we can do is show your support by adding your name to say =
you want to reinstate the Voting Rights Act. Click here to add your name:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/reinstate-voting-rights-act

No one said a political revolution would be easy. The billionaire class =
doesn't want to see our movement win, and so we must do everything we can =
to show them that we have the power.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Dear Bernie Supporter -

Today our Bernie 2016 Targeting Analyst Ben Muirhead came over to my desk =
and told me that we can win New York State -- a critical upcoming contest, =
with 227 pledged delegates at stake -- but we need to register 13,000 more =
new NY voters in time for the deadline, which is TOMORROW.

We've done the math and if one thousand of you get on the phones this =
afternoon and evening for 2 - 3 hours each to call unregistered New =
Yorkers, we can hit this goal.

MAKE CALLS TO NEW YORKERS NOW =C2=BB =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/nyphonebank/

Since February 1st, in every primary or caucus where we've won or picked =
up significant delegates, the participation of new and young voters has =
been essential. In the states coming up, we can do very well if we focus =
our efforts on expanding the electorate, and then make sure new voters =
turn out.

Time is short, and our goal is big, but it's nothing compared to what this =
movement has already accomplished.

Make calls now to help us meet our New York voter registration goal. =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/nyphonebank/

Thank you for all you do.

In solidarity,

Claire Sandberg

Sisters and Brothers -

The political establishment may want us to step aside before the map =
shifts in our favor. The corporate media may continue to write us off as =
they have throughout this entire campaign.

But one thing is clear: the working families of this country who are held =
back by a rigged economy kept in place by a corrupt system of campaign =
finance are still fighting to take their country back from the billionaire =
class:

Bloomberg National Poll - March 24, 2016
Bernie Sanders: 49%
Hillary Clinton: 48%

Our surge in the polls couldn't come at a more important time. With three =
caucuses on Saturday, we are poised to significantly cut into Hillary =
Clinton's delegate lead, and that's why there's no more important time for =
us to ask:

Contribute $3 today ahead of Saturday's three critical caucuses. Every =
delegate matters, and your contribution could mean the difference between =
hitting our goals, or falling just short:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/surge-in-the-polls

Up until this point, Hillary Clinton's campaign has been funded almost =
entirely by high-dollar donors, and this week is no different. She has a =
series of fundraising events asking people to bundle as much as $50,000 a =
piece.

But we have you. And if we continue to stand together and fight against =
the billionaire class trying to buy this election, we can win.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers -

In the movie Oceans 11, a gang of lovable thieves successfully heisted =
$150 million from a vault in the basement of the Bellagio Hotel and Casino =
in Las Vegas.

Fueled primarily from high-dollar donations, Hillary Clinton has raised =
more than that in this campaign, and is now enlisting the support of =
George Clooney (Danny Ocean) to pad that total at a dinner event that will =
cost people up to $353,400 to attend.

Now, most of us can agree that is an obscene amount of money. It's a sum =
that would require an employee making the federal minimum wage to work 24 =
hours a day, 365 days a year for more than 5 years.

This is what we're up against in this campaign, and why it's so impressive =
we've held our own raising $5, $10, $27 at a time from working Americans. =
But with three critical caucuses just a day away, we have to ask:

Your $3 contribution to our campaign will help us win three critical =
caucuses tomorrow, and send a message that you have had ENOUGH of =
billionaires buying our elections:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/three-critical-caucuses

Here is the truth: while tens of millions of Americans are struggling to =
put dinner on the table, the wealthiest people in this country have never =
had it so good. And the great question of this campaign is will we restore =
a vibrant democracy in this country, or will we slide into an oligarchy in =
which the economic and political life is controlled by a handful of =
billionaires?

That is our fight, and why your $3 contribution is so important.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

Sisters and Brothers -

Here's how a writer for The New York Times described our chances on the =
day we launched a little less than a year ago:

"Hillary Rodham Clinton is poised to win the Democratic nomination without =
a serious contest." - April 30, 2015

A BuzzFeed editor said Bernie was not "a serious candidate." A writer for =
The Washington Post said 12 percent was a "reasonable ceiling for =
Sanders."

The truth is, the corporate media has written us off from day one. But =
time and time again, we've defied the odds and proved them wrong. And =
after everyone sees the results from tomorrow's caucuses, with more than =

Thank you, sisters and brothers!

Our campaign was just declared the winner of two more states: Washington =
State with 101 delegates, and Alaska with 16 delegates. These are our =
fourth and fifth wins out of the last six results, and there's still =
another caucus today where we expect to do very well.

We'll be in touch with the results from Hawaii, but this is shaping up to =
be a tremendous day for our campaign. And with a big showdown in Wisconsin =
on the horizon, it's important that we keep the momentum going.

Make a $3 contribution to our campaign today and we can win this =
Democratic primary, the White House, and take our country back from the =
billionaire class:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/alaska-and-washington

When we started this campaign no one thought we would win a single state, =
let alone 13 out of the first 31. No one thought we could compete =
financially with the most prolific fundraiser in Democratic Party history, =
especially by relying on small-dollar contributions from working =
Americans.

We keep proving the political establishment and corporate media wrong. And =
if we continue to stand together, we are going to win.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

We are on a path towards victory, and we took three more steps down that =
path last night with three YUGE wins in Alaska, Hawaii and Washington.

We won each of those states with more than 68 percent of the vote, same as =
we did last week in Idaho, Utah, and Democrats Abroad. We are =
significantly shrinking Hillary Clinton's lead, and we're going to keep it =
up.

You are the momentum for our campaign. When you vote, caucus, volunteer, =
or make a contribution, you are building our momentum. Every ballot, every =
phone call or door knocked, and every dollar moves us forward.

We are only doing so well because millions of people want us to do well. =
No billionaires, no super PACs. Just you, and the rest of our political =
revolution.

Make a $3 contribution to our campaign now to keep building our momentum =
before Wisconsin votes:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/you-are-the-momentum

When working people and young people, when people who have given up on the =
political process get involved, that's how we win. They demand a =
government that represents them and not the 1 percent of our country. And =
if enough of us come together, they'll get it.

Right now we have the momentum. Momentum is having 14,000 people out in a =
rally in Salt Lake City about a week ago and 15,000 in Seattle on Monday =
night.

Momentum is in election after election, winning an overwhelming percentage =
of young people who are participating in the democratic process.

Momentum is having rallies and town meetings that have brought out more =
than one million people over the course of this campaign.

What we are seeing is that the people of this country want to make it a =
better country. They are prepared to stand up and fight and take on the =
major crises that we face. They want an economy that works for all of us, =
not just wealthy campaign contributors. They want the United States of =
America to join every other major country and guarantee health care to all =
people as a right.

Conservative, progressive, Republican, or Democrat -- they are all =
embarrassed by a corrupt campaign finance system that allows billionaires =
to buy elections.

And so they are fighting back, with almost 6 million contributions from =
nearly 2 million people, at an average of about $27 apiece.

Make a contribution of $3 right now to continue to build our momentum so =
we can win the Democratic nomination, the White House, and take back our =
country from the billionaire class:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/you-are-the-momentum

I'm glad you are a part of this with me. Thank you.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

With six wins in our last seven contests, when everything is tallied we'll =
have cut into Hillary Clinton's lead by about 20 percent.

Now we focus our attention on Wisconsin, a state Governor Scott Walker has =
turned into ground zero for the fight for workers' rights, women's rights, =
and voting rights. And a place where we are EXCRUCIATINGLY close to =
pulling off another shocking victory:

Emerson Poll in Wisconsin (3/20 to 3/22)
Clinton: 50%
Sanders: 44%

Make a $3 contribution to Bernie 2016 today and we are going to shock the =
world -- once again -- in Wisconsin. And when we do, we'll be one step =
closer to victory in this primary:

https://go.berniesanders.com/keep-up-the-momentum

You better believe the Clinton campaign wants to stop us right here, right =
now in Wisconsin.

Not many people expected us to respond to March 15th with a series of =
overwhelming victories. Most folks in the political establishment were =
hoping we'd go away.

But our campaign is still here, and we are stronger than ever. We're =
winning states, and we're winning delegates. If we keep it up, we can win =
this nomination. But that will require all of us standing together, =
especially ahead of our critical FEC fundraising deadline this week:

Contribute $3 to Bernie 2016 today, and we're going to win Wisconsin.

https://go.berniesanders.com/keep-up-the-momentum

In every single state except Vermont, our campaign started way down in the =
polls. But once we've been able to get there and get organizing, we come =
back and either make it close, or we win. In Wisconsin, we're going to =
win.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers -

When our campaign first set foot in Wisconsin this past summer, we got a =
very warm welcome from the people of Wisconsin. I spoke to more than =
10,000 people in Madison about our corrupt political system, our broken =
economy, and how our political revolution can take back our country from =
people like the Koch Brothers in the billionaire class.

Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and the Republican Party weren't as happy =
to see me. Governor Walker, who has been helped throughout his career by =
the Koch Brothers, issued statements against us, and the GOP even put up =
billboards calling me an "extremist."

Well, let's talk about extremism. Scott Walker has attacked the minimum =
wage, gutted unions, made it much harder to vote, and restricted access to =
abortion. That is extremism.

I can think of no better place for our political revolution to continue =
its momentum than in Wisconsin. The latest poll has us down just a few =
points, and I know that if we work together right now, we can pull off a =
huge victory.

With a huge FEC fundraising deadline on Thursday at midnight, there has =
not been a more important time for you to support our campaign.

Make a $3 contribution to our campaign now before Thursday night's =
deadline and we can shock the political establishment with a victory in =
Wisconsin:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lets-continue-our-momentum

Not only has Governor Walker been helped throughout his career by huge =
financial support from the Koch Brothers, but he has enacted their =
ideology while in office.

When you deny the right of workers to come together in collective =
bargaining, that's extremism.

When you tell a woman that she cannot control her own body, that's =
extremism.

When you give tax breaks to billionaires and refuse to raise the minimum =
wage, that's extremism.

Our views, which represent the views of the vast majority of the American =
people, are a little bit different. We believe that the time has come for =
the people of Wisconsin and all over the country to create a movement that =
tells the billionaire class: YOU CAN'T HAVE IT ALL!

And what we are saying to the Koch Brothers and Scott Walker is that this =
great country belongs to everybody, and not just a handful of very wealthy =
people.

Contribute $3 right now to say you stand with our political revolution and =
help us win in Wisconsin next week:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lets-continue-our-momentum

When the people stand together against the Koch Brothers and the =
billionaire class, we can win.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Dear Bernie Supporter,

Together, we've won six out of seven of the last contests -- by some very =
large margins -- and we're gaining momentum every day.

Make no mistake about it: your volunteer efforts -- your phone calls and =
your time spent knocking on doors -- are what's moving the needle in these =
races and bringing us closer to the nomination.

But we can't stop now. April will be a critical month for our campaign, =
and in order to win, we're going to need everyone's help -- starting right =
now. Can you get on the phones to help us identify Bernie supporters, or =
host a phonebank party?

YES, I WILL MAKE CALLS FROM HOME:
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/phonebank/

YES, I'LL HOST A PHONEBANKING PARTY:
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/host-a-phonebank-for-bernie?source=3De=
m160328

Together, we're building the largest grassroots voter contact machine in =
history, one that will make our political revolution a reality.

In solidarity,

- Team Bernie

Sisters and Brothers -

You have to see this Wall Street Journal headline from late last week:

"Hillary Clinton Begins Shift to the General Election"

Unfortunately for the Clinton campaign's plans, voters got in the way. =
We've won six of the last seven contests, and took 82% of the vote in =
Alaska, 73% in Washington, and 70% in Hawaii.

Here's the truth: the Clinton campaign and their allies in the financial =
and political establishment are desperately trying to write us off. Their =
goal is to get you to stop fighting -- to stop volunteering, to stop =
donating -- because they know that if we continue to stand together, we =
can win.

Now we have to focus on next Tuesday's primary in Wisconsin, another large =
state where we can do very well.

Make a $3 contribution to Bernie's campaign ahead of our critical FEC =
fundraising deadline, and we are going to win Wisconsin and move one step =
close to the Democratic nomination:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lets-continue-our-momentum

For the past several years, Wisconsin has been ground zero for worker's =
rights, women's rights, and voting rights. Those people cannot afford to =
wait for incremental change -- they need a president who will think big =
about the transformational change required of this moment. And that is =
what Bernie will deliver.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers -

One of the great accomplishments of this campaign is proving to candidates =
everywhere that you don't have to beg millionaires and billionaires for =
money to run a successful campaign.

And that is important because you cannot start to change a rigged economy, =
combat climate change, or take on people who profit from high drug prices =
by relying on their money.

So I want you to imagine what that will mean when we win and politicians =
decide they don't need to take money from the financial elite who are =
buying our candidates and elections. It will mean we can start to create =
an economy that works for everyone and not just wealthy campaign =
contributors, that we can stop fracking and leave fossil fuels in the =
ground, that we can provide health care as a right for every man, woman =
and child in this country.

That is how your contribution can change the world. And it's why we have =
to ask:

Make a $3 contribution to our campaign before Thursday's critical FEC =
fundraising deadline and we will win Wisconsin, the Democratic primary, =
and take our country back from the billionaire class:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-can-change-the-world

When we talk about a political revolution in this country, we are not =
talking about tinkering around the edges or incremental change. Our =
political system is corrupt and big money controls much of what happens in =
Washington, D.C. This moment in our history requires transformational =
change.

And if we continue to stand together, that is what we are going to =
accomplish through this campaign. Wisconsin is next, and Bernie needs you.

Sisters and Brothers -

One of the next big battlegrounds for the Democratic nomination is New =
York State's primary on April 19. We've repeatedly asked Hillary Clinton =
to debate in New York before the primary, but her campaign hasn't agreed =
to it.

Then there was a really strange headline yesterday. You should see it:

"Clinton campaign: Future debates depend upon Sanders' tone"

If the Clinton campaign thinks gentle contrasts on the issues from Bernie =
in debates are too tough, how would she face Trump's legitimately vicious =
attacks if she were the nominee? It doesn't bode well.

Voters deserve a chance to hear from candidates before they vote. That's =
pretty simple. We think there should be a debate in New York before the =
primary.

Add your name if you want to see a debate in New York between Hillary =
Clinton and Bernie Sanders before the New York primary.

ADD YOUR NAME =C2=BB https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/new-york-debate

The April 19 primary in New York is a significant stop along the path to =
the Democratic nomination. It's where a huge number of Democratic votes =
will get the chance to decide who they want to go head-to-head with Donald =
Trump.

But if the Clinton campaign is afraid of voters hearing from Bernie, it =
doesn't seem great if they actually want to face Donald Trump on a debate =
stage in the fall. It's worth remembering that in poll after poll, Bernie =
does the best against Donald Trump.

Bernie thinks that New York voters should get to hear from both Democratic =
candidates before they vote - add your name if you agree.

Sanders to debate before the New York primary:

A LITTLE BIRDIE TOLD BERNIE WE WERE GOING TO DO VERY, VERY WELL LAST =
WEEKEND

The day before we swept three critical West Coast caucuses, Bernie's rally =
in Portland was momentarily interrupted when a little bird landed on his =
podium. The crowd in attendance loved it, and word spread quickly among =
our supporters across the country. So we decided to make a sticker to =
commemorate the event.

Make a contribution of ANY AMOUNT to our campaign and we'll get this =
Birdie Sanders out to you in the mail:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/birdie-sanders

We have a very limited number of stickers, so this email is probably your =
only chance to get one. All you have to do is make a contribution of ANY =
AMOUNT and we'll get it out in the mail.

Thank you for standing with Bernie... and Birdie.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

Sisters and Brothers -

Stop me if you've heard this one before.

Tonight Hillary Clinton is in New York City at a fundraiser with the =
former Chief Financial Officer of the huge investment bank Morgan Stanley. =
Some attendees are bundling as much as $27,000.

At the same time she's at this Wall Street fundraiser, Bernie is talking =
with voters in Wisconsin tonight before Tuesday's primary.

I think you know what I'm about to ask you to do before tomorrow night's =
FEC fundraising deadline...

Contribute $27 to our campaign and help us take on the billionaire class =
and win the Democratic nomination.

CONTRIBUTE $27 =C2=BB =
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/27_dollars

Your contribution to our campaign allows Bernie to actually speak with =
voters and rally supporters. This makes all the difference and is a big =
reason why we've been so successful.

Our campaign is powered by nearly 6 million individual contributions from =
almost 2 million people, with an average contribution of just $27. No =
billionaires, no bundling bankers, no super PACs. Just you, and our =
political revolution. Thank you.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers -

Hillary Clinton left the campaign trail for yet another high-dollar =
fundraising event on Monday, but she shared some news about the state of =
the race that we agree with: she said the trail to the Democratic =
nomination "goes through Wisconsin."

We've won six of the last seven contests and have all the momentum. And we =
have a chance to build on that significantly when Wisconsin votes in a =
little over a week. It's a state Hillary Clinton once led by over 40 =
points, but we have cut the margin down to single digits.

One thing is for sure: we are fighting for every last vote. But with so =
much on the line, you can bet Hillary Clinton and the financial elite =
funding her campaign will be as well. That's why we have to ask:

Can Bernie count on you to contribute  $3 before Thursday's critical FEC =
fundraising deadline to help us win Wisconsin and the Democratic =
nomination?

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/why-wisconsin-matters

We have come so far in Wisconsin, and in this race, to come up short. We =
expect that it's going to be close, and every contribution made between =
now and Thursday's deadline could make a real difference in determining =
the outcome. Thank you for continuing to stand with Bernie, and for =
leading this political revolution.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

Everyone loves Birdie Sanders, but these stickers are about to fly away!

A little birdie said hello to Bernie this week at a rally. Everyone LOVES =
the Birdie Sanders stickers we made to celebrate, but they're going very =
quickly. This is your absolute LAST CHANCE to get a Birdie Sanders =
sticker. You won't hear from us again about it. Once they're gone, they're =
gone.

Make ANY contribution to our campaign to receive your Birdie Sanders =
sticker. This is your LAST CHANCE!

Contribute any amount and receive our Birdie Sanders sticker.

We can't be clear enough: this is your last opportunity to get Birdie =
Sanders stickers. They'll disappear before tomorrow night's FEC =
fundraising deadline.

Contribute ANY amount right now and we'll put your Birdie Sanders sticker =
in the mail.

Don't wait - early bird gets the sticker!

Sisters and Brothers -

At midnight tonight we will have to turn in our numbers from our final =
fundraising deadline before the critical primaries in April. A lot of =
people in the corporate media and other establishment types are trying to =
call this race for Secretary Clinton. They want us to drop out. They want =
to be able to say, "oh Bernie's fundraising is slowing down." But we're =
going to prove them wrong today.

Last month we raised an unbelievable $43.5 million from working people =
giving just a little bit each online. If we were to raise more money by =
the end of this month at midnight tonight, it would send an unmistakable =
message to the media and the establishment: we are going to win this =
campaign and the White House.

That's why we're setting a big goal today to reach more than $43.5 million =
by midnight's FEC deadline. Contribute now to help us get there:

Make a $3 contribution and help us reach a huge goal of raising $43.5 =
million in March before tonight's critical FEC fundraising deadline.

We started today having raised more than $39 million in March from more =
than 1.5 million individual contributions. I have no idea if we can reach =
our goal by midnight. But if we do, it will not only send an unmistakable =
message about the size and strength of our movement -- it will also ensure =
we have the resources to win this Democratic primary. That's why your $3 =
contribution before midnight is so important:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-radical-idea

When we started this campaign we were at about 3 percent in the polls and =
Secretary Clinton was beating us by 60 points. We have come a long way.

Now we are coming to some very important primaries and caucuses over the =
next weeks in Wisconsin, Wyoming and New York. That's why your =
contribution right now is so important. Please help us reach our goal:

Add a $3 contribution so that we can meet our goal and astonish the media =
and political establishments and send an unmistakable message about the =
strength of our movement:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-radical-idea

Thank you for standing with me.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers - Bernie doesn't go around asking millionaires and =
billionaires for money. There are no oligarchs waiting in the wings to =
save us.

If we are going to win in Wisconsin on Tuesday, it's going to be because =
millions of Americans have come together to say they have had ENOUGH of =
billionaires buying our candidates and elections.

It's still a long shot, but it looks like we have a chance to reach our =
goal of raising more money from individual, small-dollar contributions in =
March than we did last month. And if you add a $3 contribution before our =
critical midnight deadline, I think we'll get there:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-radical-idea

When we started this campaign, no one gave us a chance in the world. They =
said our ideas were "radical," that we were a "fringe" campaign not to be =
taken seriously. They said there was no way we'd be able to compete with =
the millionaires and billionaires lined up to fund Hillary Clinton's =
campaign.

But what we are doing on this campaign is proving the doubters wrong, and =
we are doing it time and time again.

We've won six of our last seven contests and have a chance to do very well =
in Wisconsin on Tuesday night. The political establishment and financial =
elite in this country are dead set on stopping our momentum. But if we =
continue to stand together, we are going to win.

Make a $3 contribution to our campaign before our critical midnight FEC =
fundraising deadline and we are going to hit our goal and do very well in =
Wisconsin:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-radical-idea

Reaching this goal would send a very powerful message to everyone paying =
attention (and there are A LOT of people paying attention) that not only =
are we not going anywhere, but we are going to win.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

 - I don't think I'm too far off to say that this is a headline few in the =
political establishment would have thought possible even a couple months =
ago:

"Bernie Sanders outraises Hillary Clinton for third month straight; aims =
to win Wisconsin on Tuesday"

If we all pull together today, we could wake up to that headline tomorrow. =
And based on the response already today, I think it's very possible. =
Thousands of our supporters have already chipped in today to help us reach =
our goal. Add your contribution to theirs right now:=20

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-radical-idea

Let's be real: at the beginning of this contest, it wasn't really a fair =
fight. We were up against an opponent with millionaires, billionaires, =
super PACs, and a good chunk of Wall Street in her corner.

What we've proven is that millions of people standing together in a =
political revolution can take on the billionaire class. And when we hit =
our goal tonight, we are going to send a powerful message to those who =
have yet to vote that we have what it takes to defeat the billionaire =
class in this election. That's why we have to ask:

Can Bernie count on you to make a $3 contribution for tonight's FEC =
fundraising deadline? You can do that here:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-radical-idea

Every single contribution we receive before midnight should be seen as a =
declaration of support for the values we share. People should not =
underestimate us.

More important numbers for you on a very important day before our midnight =
FEC deadline. Check 'em out:

- In the next 27 days, eight more states will vote with 731 delegates up =
for grabs. That's 3 times as many delegates as we need to overtake Hillary =
Clinton's lead.

- In those same 27 days, Hillary Clinton and her campaign are hosting at =
least 46 high-dollar fundraising events, including one event where people =
contribute as much as $353,400.

- The average contribution to our campaign is just $27 - a figure that is =
important because it speaks to the fact that we are powered by working =
families, not the billionaire class.

Add your $27 contribution right now before our midnight FEC fundraising =
deadline to show that you are part of our political revolution, not the =
billionaire class:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-radical-idea?amount=3D27&refc=
ode=3Dem160331s4

Why does Bernie always mention the fact that the average contribution to =
our campaign is $27? It's because what we're doing is actually pretty =
unprecedented in modern American politics.

Since Citizens United, all of the incentive for politicians is to raise =
money from millionaires and billionaires and give their blessing to super =
PACs. We're doing it a different way.

We don't have a super PAC. There are no oligarchs waiting in the wings. No =
Wall Street fundraisers.

It's you, your $27 contribution, and our political revolution. Make your =
contribution right now before our midnight FEC fundraising deadline:

Sisters and Brothers -

Tonight Hillary Clinton is hosting two high-dollar fundraisers where some =
attendees at one event will pay $2700 each to get a photo with her. I'm =
sorry to say that is not what I'm offering.

I have a rally in the Bronx tonight to speak to voters before the New York =
primary. But because we run our campaign a little differently, I have a =
proposal for something else.

We're going to hold a fundraiser right here, right now, across America. =
And my request is to please make a contribution of $3 to help raise us the =
funds we need to win in Wisconsin, win in New York, and win the Democratic =
nomination for president:

<strong><a =
href=3D"https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-radical-idea

We're trying to raise more money this month than we did last month. We're =
still short of our goal, but I know that with your contribution right now, =
we can hit it.

So, there it is, that's our fundraiser. Thanks for being a part of it.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

We have a secret for you - you've been selected to get one of the last of =
our 'Birdie Sanders' stickers.

Make ANY contribution before midnight and get one of our last Birdie =
Sanders stickers:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/birdie-sanders

The day before we swept three critical West Coast caucuses last Saturday, =
Bernie's rally in Portland was momentarily interrupted when a little bird =
landed on his podium. The crowd in attendance loved it, and word spread =
quickly among our supporters across the country. So we decided to make a =
sticker to commemorate the event.

Make a contribution of ANY AMOUNT to our campaign and we'll get this =
Birdie Sanders out to you in the mail:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/birdie-sanders

Thank you for standing with Bernie... and Birdie.

In solidarity,

Team Bernie----

Just two weeks ago they were calling for us to get out the race. Now we're =
going to show the world that our political revolution can win the =
Democratic nomination, the White House, and take our country back from the =

Thank you, sisters and brothers. I am overwhelmed and I am moved by the =
fact that in March alone, our campaign received more than 1.7 million =
individual contributions from working Americans, and that it was our most =
successful fundraising month of the campaign.

Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined that so many people would =
come together in a way that is not only unprecedented, but is transforming =
American politics. Since we started building this political revolution =
together, we have received more than 6.5 million individual contributions. =
And do you know what our average contribution is?

Just $27.

What we are doing through our campaign is proving that you don't have to =
go around begging Wall Street, fossil fuel lobbyists, and pharmaceutical =
executives for outrageous sums of money in order to run a winning =
campaign.

I am very proud of that fact. You should be as well.

And building this kind of broad-based, grassroots movement is important =
because this moment in our history requires transformational change that =
no candidate for president, not Bernie Sanders or anybody else, can =
achieve alone.

That is why we are building a political revolution that is bringing =
millions of people together. Working people who have given up on the =
political process. Blacks and whites, Latinos, Asian Americans, Native =
Americans, straight, gay and transgender, female and male, people who were =
born in America and people who immigrated here all joining with each =
other.

And what we are saying loudly and clearly at every volunteer event, every =
rally, and with every contribution is that we believe this government =
belongs to all of us, and not just a wealthy few campaign donors.

That is what this campaign is about.

That is the political revolution.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

During a campaign stop and fundraiser in New York yesterday, Hillary =
Clinton was asked by a young woman if she'd stop taking money from the =
fossil fuel industry. It was a simple question, one she could have easily =
answered with a "yes," or, perhaps because of the way she funds her =
campaign, responded with a "no."

Instead, she said she was "sick of the Sanders' campaign lying" about the =
donations she receives.

Now, here's the truth -- the hard numbers don't lie. And it's something =
everyone should know as this video spreads online and is covered in the =
news: The fossil fuel industry has given more than $4.5 million to Hillary =
Clinton's campaign and her top super PAC, including 11 lobbyists who have =
bundled more than $1 million to her put her in the White House.

Earlier in this campaign, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley signed a =
pledge to refuse money from fossil fuel interests. No Republican added =
their name, which isn't surprising given that they don't believe climate =
change is real. But neither did Hillary Clinton. It's time for her to =
distance herself from the Republicans on this issue and add her name.

Ask Hillary Clinton to sign the pledge launched by Greenpeace USA and 20 =
other organizations asking all presidential candidates to reject fossil =
fuel contributions, because you cannot be expected to take an industry on =
while you're taking their money:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/fossil-fuel-industry

When we talk about our responsibilities as humans beings, there is nothing =
more important than leaving this country and entire planet in a way that =
is habitable to our children and grandchildren. Donald Trump may believe =
that climate change is a hoax being perpetrated by the Chinese, but for =
almost everyone else, the debate is over. The scientific community is =
unanimous on this issue.

And what the scientists are saying is that we must boldly transform our =
energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency. =
Unfortunately one of the biggest obstacles to realizing that goal is a =
corrupt system of campaign finance that enriches the CEOs of fossil fuel =
companies at the expense of average Americans and our planet.

The easiest way to reject their influence is to refuse their money. And it =
would send a powerful message if the leading presidential candidates in =
the Democratic Party both stand up and say ENOUGH is ENOUGH, we are tired =
of fossil fuel companies regulating Congress with their campaign =
contributions and not the other way around.

Bernie has taken that pledge. It's time for Hillary Clinton to join him.

Ask Hillary Clinton to sign the pledge launched by Greenpeace USA and 20 =
other organizations asking all presidential candidates to reject fossil =
fuel contributions, because you cannot be expected to take an industry on =
while you're taking their money:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/fossil-fuel-industry

The United States must lead the world in fighting climate change. CEOs are =
making record profits, while climate change ravages our planet and our =
people. Refusing their money is the first step towards combatting their =
obscene influence.

Dear Bernie Supporter,

Have you seen the latest polling on Wisconsin?

Public Policy Polling (March 31, 2016)
Bernie Sanders: 49%
Hillary Clinton: 43%
Undecided: 8%

With 86 pledged delegates at stake, Wisconsin is a critical state for our =
political revolution. When Wisconsin votes on Tuesday, not only do we have =
the chance to rack up another win, but - even more critically - we have =
the opportunity to chip away at our opponent's delegate lead and bring our =
campaign closer to the nomination.

With polls showing eight percent of voters still undecided just four days =
out, we urgently need your help reaching Wisconsin voters in time before =
Tuesday. Can you help us bring Bernie's message to Wisconsin voters today?

CALL WISCONSIN VOTERS FROM HOME =C2=BB =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/wiphonebank

Or join a phonebank event near you to call Wisconsin voters with other =
volunteers:
http://map.berniesanders.com/#zipcode=3D03223&distance=3D20&sort=3Dtime&f%=
5B%5D=3Dphonebank

This campaign has already defied the laws of political gravity and put the =
political, financial, and media establishment on notice. And we're not =
through yet.

On Tuesday, we'll get another chance to show the world that we won't stop =
fighting until we take our country back from the billionaire class. But we =
can't do it without your help delivering this message to the voters in the =
most effective way possible - one by one.

Let's do this.

In solidarity,

Claire Sandberg
Bernie 2016

Sisters and Brothers -

If you were wondering how the political and financial establishment of =
this country would respond to us winning six of seven contests, most of =
them by extraordinary margins, here's your answer:

Over the next 15 days alone, Hillary Clinton's campaign has scheduled 33 =
high-dollar fundraisers. While Bernie is campaigning in Wisconsin and New =
York, the Clinton campaign is traveling to places that have already voted =
like Colorado, Virginia, and Florida to collect massive checks, including =
one event where couples can contribute $353,000 to sit with George =
Clooney.

Now, there's nothing wrong with George Clooney. Everybody loves George =
Clooney. We'll even plug his new movie, "Money Monster" that appears to be =
about the destruction caused by the greed, recklessness, and fraud on Wall =
Street.

But that $353,000 is an outrageous sum of money. And one of the great =
questions of this campaign is whether people coming together can overcome =
the electoral influence of a small number of millionaires and billionaires =
who are buying our elections.

That is why as we near the Wisconsin primary, we have to ask:

Can Bernie count on you to contribute $3 to our campaign to help us win in =
Wisconsin and as a way of saying you have had ENOUGH of millionaires and =
billionaires buying elections? You can do that here:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/before-the-wisconsin-primary

The next three weeks are likely the most important of the campaign. =
Wisconsin votes, New York votes, Wyoming caucuses, and a handful of large =
and important states make their choice on April 26th.

The political and financial establishment of this country are hoping that =
we've run out of gas. And that's because they know that if we continue to =
stand together, we have a very good chance to win this Democratic primary.

That's why your $3 contribution to our campaign is so important:

Here's the truth, sisters and brothers: this is probably the most =
important three week stretch of the campaign.

In just two days Wisconsin votes, and after winning six of our last seven =
contests, the outcome there will go a long way toward determining who has =
the momentum heading into New York's primary.

But more importantly, there are a lot of delegates at stake on Tuesday, =
and we are organizing and fighting for each and every one of them. But so =
are Hillary Clinton and her backers in the political and financial =
establishment. They'd love nothing more than to halt our momentum in =
Wisconsin.

Back when everyone was laughing at us, we were down 40 points in =
Wisconsin. Now they are desperate to stop us. But if we stand together =
through Tuesday, we are going to win:

Make a $3 contribution to Bernie's campaign today and we are going to win =
Wisconsin. This is the most important three week stretch of the campaign, =
so there's no more important time to contribute than right now:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/most-important-3-weeks

As far as we've come in this campaign and in Wisconsin, it would feel =
terrible to come up just short on Tuesday night. But you should know that =
every hour between now and the time the polls close, our supporters are =
working hard to turn out each every vote. Your contribution goes toward =
supporting their work, and that's why it's so important you make one =
today.

Sisters and Brothers -

This is what our wins from six of the last seven contests look like, with =
our expected delegate totals. I'll be blunt: I very, very much want to add =
Wisconsin to this list Tuesday night.

Democrats Abroad - 3/21
Bernie Sanders: 69% (9 delegates)
Hillary Clinton: 31% (4 delegates)

Idaho - 3/22
Bernie Sanders: 78% (17 delegates)
Hillary Clinton: 21% (5 delegates)

Utah - 3/22
Bernie Sanders: 79% (26 delegates)
Hillary Clinton: 20% (6 delegates)

Alaska - 3/26
Bernie Sanders: 82% (13 delegates)
Hillary Clinton: 18% (3 delegates)

Hawaii - 3/26
Bernie Sanders: 70% (17 delegates)
Hillary Clinton: 30% (8 delegates)

Washington - 3/26
Bernie Sanders: 73% (74 delegates)
Hillary Clinton: 27% (27 delegates)

Make your $3 contribution right now and help ensure that Bernie wins =
Wisconsin on Tuesday:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/most-important-3-weeks

If we win Wisconsin on Tuesday, we'll have the momentum we need to win New =
York State and absolutely astound the political establishment. But as good =
as a win in Wisconsin would be, it would be more devastating to fall just =
short.

Let's make sure we add Wisconsin to the win column. Add your contribution =
now.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers -

If there is one lesson everyone has learned in this race, it's that the =
moment a campaign takes victory for granted is the moment they lose. =
Tomorrow's Wisconsin primary is very, very close. We've won six of the =
last seven contests, and a recent CBS News poll shows we cannot take the =
next one for granted.

CBS News - Wisconsin Primary (3/29 to 4/1)
Bernie Sanders: 49%
Hillary Clinton: 47%

The political establishment and corporate media have counted us out time =
and time again in this race, we should not make the same mistake with a =
campaign as formidable and well-funded as Hillary Clinton's in Wisconsin.

Make a $3 contribution before Wisconsin votes tomorrow and we are going to =
win that state and continue our historic march to the nomination. Your =
donation could be the difference in such a close race:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/before-wisconsin-votes

We were down more than 40 points in Wisconsin shortly before we got into =
this race. Today, some polls show us up and some show us down. We are on =
the verge of making history tomorrow night, but doing so will require us =
to work hard for every last vote up until the minute the polls close. =
That's why your contribution matters so much.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

Sisters and Brothers -

The political establishment hoped to have a party earlier this year. They =
spared no expense, either. Wall Street was going to cater the whole thing, =
and they even got super PACs to be bouncers at the door.

Everything was going great ... until voters showed up.

We fought to a virtual tie in Iowa. We won New Hampshire by a huge margin. =
We've won six out of the last seven contests. And each time they're about =
ready to pop the champagne, more voters show up for Bernie. So let's do it =
again in Wisconsin on Tuesday.

Make a $3 contribution to Bernie 2016 right now and we can win Tuesday's =
Wisconsin primary:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/establishment-party

Let's be real. The political establishment thinks Bernie supporters are a =
bunch of party crashers. They don't like that we showed up to the =
political process, and they don't like that we are sticking around either.

Bad news for them: we keep winning, and we intend to win the Democratic =
nomination. Our path continues through Wisconsin on Tuesday, Wyoming on =
Saturday, and New York later this month.

Let's keep going with a Wisconsin win Tuesday night. Make a $3 =
contribution to Bernie 2016 now:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/establishment-party

No matter what, we can't stop believing in Bernie.

Sisters and Brothers -

Today is a very important day for our campaign. We've won six of the last =
seven contests and have a chance to do VERY well in Wisconsin tonight.

This isn't something the political establishment ever expected. That's =
probably why one of the Clinton campaign's largest super PACs, the one run =
by former Republican hatchet man David Brock, has ratcheted up its attacks =
dramatically.

But their attacks over the past week are NOTHING compared to what we can =
expect if we win Wisconsin tonight. The Clinton campaign and its super =
PACs are going to throw everything they can at us, and we need to be =
prepared to fight, organize, and win in New York. That's why we have to =
ask:

Contribute $3 to our campaign before the polls close in Wisconsin tonight, =
and we're going to come out of tonight prepared to respond to anything the =
Clinton campaign and its super PACs throw our way:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/fight-organize-win

When we started our campaign, we were down more than 40 points in =
Wisconsin and no one gave us a chance. Today, we have a chance to do very =
well. When we started our campaign, we were down almost 50 points in New =
York, and today there are polls showing us having cut Hillary Clinton's =
lead down to 10.

We are a campaign on the move, and if we continue to stand together and =
fight against the political and financial establishment who are trying to =
stop us in New York, we are going to win. That's why your $3 contribution =
to our campaign before the polls close in Wisconsin is so critically =
important:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/fight-organize-win

Real change comes about when large numbers of ordinary Americans speak, =
vote and get involved in the democratic process. That is what we are doing =
on this campaign.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

Sisters and Brothers - Moments ago the news networks called another state =
for our political revolution, and it's a big one: Wisconsin.

The corporate media and political establishment keep counting us out, but =
we keep winning states and doing so by large margins. If we can keep this =
up, we're going to shock them all and win this nomination.

Contribute $3 to our campaign tonight and we are going to keep winning =
states by large margins until we win this nomination and take our country =
back from the billionaire class:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-won-wisconsin

Wyoming caucuses in just four days and New York votes two weeks from =
today, and you can bet the financial elite of this country won't give up =
without a fight. They're going to throw everything they can at us. But if =
we stand together, we're going to keep winning.

Tonight kicked off the most important three week stretch of the campaign, =
and we did it with another overwhelming victory. If we can keep our =
momentum going through the states that vote and caucus over the next three =
weeks, we're going to win this election.

We're doing so well because you keep standing with our campaign. Make a $3 =
contribution now and help us win Wyoming on Saturday and New York on April =
19:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-won-wisconsin

Amazing win tonight. It wouldn't have happened without you. That's the =
absolute truth.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

I want to talk about what we did last night: after starting in the polls =
in Wisconsin down more than 40 points, we finished the election with a =
HUGE margin of victory. We're also going to come away with a strong =
majority of the delegates.

We are on the path to the Democratic nomination for president. But I want =
to be clear: super PACs and the billionaire class want to block that path =
in the New York primary.

We very much expect an unbelievable amount of attacks and negativity over =
the next two weeks. But I also expect that if we all stand together, =
starting right now, we can come out of New York with another victory. =
That's why I have to ask you directly:

Contribute $3 to our campaign to help us continue our momentum from =
Wisconsin with a victory in New York in less than two weeks:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/win-in-wisconsin

One of the first sentences I wrote to our supporters after we launched our =
campaign was something few people heeded:

People should not underestimate us.

They did underestimate us. They did not think it was possible for millions =
of people to come together and win 16 contests on our path to the =
presidency.

It would be a mistake to let up for even a minute. An impressive, =
unprecedented number of people have contributed to our campaign and helped =
us get this far. We cannot stop now.

We are only as successful as we are because more than 6.5 million times, =
people have contributed an average of $27 to our campaign. Now, with a =
huge battleground primary coming up in New York, we need you more than =
ever.

Rush your $3 contribution to our campaign now and keep us on this path to =
victory:

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

You MUST see what CNN reported last night. It's very disturbing, and you =
need to know about it right now.

"The Clinton campaign has been watching these Wisconsin results come in, =
and the delegate race of course is tight there, but the reality is they're =
running out of patience. So they're going to begin deploying a new =
strategy, it's going to be called disqualify him, defeat him and then they =
can unify the party later."
Disqualify him, defeat him, and unify the party later.

One more time. This is the Clinton campaign's strategy going forward: =
Disqualify Bernie, defeat our movement, and pick up the pieces later.

We have to get ready for the Clinton campaign's attacks. We're on the path =
to the nomination, and now they're going to try to block it with super =
PACs, billionaires, and everything else they've got.

Contribute $3 to Bernie 2016 right now to help us get ready for the New =
York primary and be able to fend off whatever the billionaire class throws =
at us next:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-have-to-be-ready

Bernie's running this campaign a different way. We don't have a super PAC. =
We're not launching any negative attacks.

We're bringing together millions of people in a political revolution that =
has won seven of the last eight contests and breaks records at every turn. =
The political establishment hates what we're doing, and now it's clear the =
Clinton campaign is going to do everything in its power to stop us.

We can't let up now.

Make a $3 contribution to our campaign right now and help us win the =
Democratic nomination and take our country back from the billionaire =
class:

Sisters and Brothers -

Hillary Clinton herself just unleashed the first part of the new =
"disqualify him, defeat him and then they can unify the party later" =
strategy we told you about. Look at this new headline:

Washington Post: "Clinton questions whether Sanders is qualified to be =
president"

Polls in Wisconsin haven't even been closed for 24 hours, and we're =
already seeing the start of the Clinton campaign's full-on attack before =
the New York primary. We knew they were getting nervous, but candidly, we =
didn't think they would go this negative so quickly. We have to be ready =
for what comes next.

Contribute $3 to Bernie 2016 right now to help us get ready for the New =
York primary and be able to fend off whatever the billionaire class throws =
at us next:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/get-ready

New York is going to be an important state for the Democratic nomination. =
Bernie was born there, Hillary Clinton moved there, and 247 delegates are =
at stake on April 19.

We've won seven of the last eight contests, and voters clearly side with =
Bernie. So now the Clinton campaign is moving beyond a discussion of the =
issues to say Bernie isn't even qualified to be president.

Meanwhile, Bernie's going to keep talking about universal health care, =
fighting climate change, making our economy work for everyone, and taking =
on our corrupt campaign finance system. Voters seem to like it -- and =
we're not going to let up now.

Contribute $3 now to help Bernie continue talking to New York voters and =
defend against the Clinton campaign's plans to disqualify and defeat our =
campaign:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/get-ready

The next two weeks until the New York primary are going to be difficult, =
but if we stand together, we can win. Thanks for standing with Bernie.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

Sisters and Brothers -

It's happening again...

In primary after primary in this campaign, we'll get to a state and find =
ourselves down 30, 40 points or more. But then we get our field operation =
running, start talking to voters, run a few ads, and people contribute to =
fund that operation. Then we find ourselves down 20 points, then 10, then =
single digits...and then we win. Check this out:

Quinnipiac - Pennsylvania (April 6, 2016)
Hillary Clinton: 50%
Bernie Sanders: 44%

Quinnipiac's first poll of this race had us down 38 points, and we've come =
all the way back. We're too close to come up short now. And if people keep =
stepping up to power our campaign with their contributions, we're going to =
win another state with A LOT of delegates.

Contribute $3 to our campaign today and Bernie is going to keep gaining in =
the polls until we win New York, Pennsylvania and this Democratic primary:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/pa-poll

This is, without question, the most important three week stretch of this =
campaign. We are waging an ambitious challenge to every piece of the =
political and financial establishment in this country, and after a string =
of overwhelming victories we have a chance to win this thing!

But we can't afford to come up short in a number of the important =
primaries and caucuses right around the corner. That's why your $3 =
contribution is just so important:

Bernie Supporter -

Phil and Nadya writing you; we're Bernie's New York State Directors. We're =
still behind in the polls, and we need your help.

We have an amazing team of staff and volunteers working around the clock, =
and we're sending literally thousands of people out to knock on doors this =
weekend.

But New York is a huge state - and for our canvassers to be successful, we =
need at least 5,000 of you on the phones over the next few days calling =
New York voters.

Will you pitch in to help Bernie win New York?

YES, I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS TO HELP BERNIE WIN NEW YORK!
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/nyphonebank/

On these short calls, you'll help identify undecided voters for our =
canvassers to persuade, our opponent's supporters for them to ignore, and =
Bernie's supporters we can recruit to volunteer. It's pretty simple, but =
this is the work that wins elections!

Our campaign's unique advantage in this race is you - the nationwide =
grassroots. And when we turn our huge supporter base into a massive voter =
contact machine, you'll help us do the work necessary to win New York and =
stun the political establishment.

So please log on and call New York voters with any free time you have =
today, tomorrow or through this weekend:
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/nyphonebank/

In solidarity,

Nadya Stevens and Phil Aroneanu
New York State Directors

Sisters and Brothers -

The truth of what's happening in this election is that the American people =
understand that you cannot change a corrupt political system by taking its =
money.

Another truth is this: if America wants a president who will truly do =
everything in his or her power to dismantle our corrupt system of campaign =
finance, then we need a president who can get elected without the help of =
Wall Street, fossil fuel lobbyists, and the billionaire class.

Our campaign doesn't owe anything to big banks, to campaign bundlers, or =
to lobbyists. The only people to whom I am beholden is our political =
revolution. Let's keep it that way.

Contribute $3 to our campaign to elect a president who isn't beholden to =
our corrupt system of campaign finance and show that we the people can =
elect our own president:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/most-important-three-weeks

When I started this campaign, I had a choice: I could have a super PAC =
funded by millionaires and billionaires, or I could run for president =
without one. The political establishment dismissed us immediately. They =
thought it was impossible to win without money from the billionaire class.

They were wrong.

The bottom line is this: we've gotten this far with more than 6.6 million =
contributions from 2 million people, and we can win the White House that =
way too.

Help us show what's possible without billionaires and super PACs with a $3 =
contribution to our campaign right now.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/most-important-three-weeks

They keep saying what we're doing is impossible. Let's keep proving them =
wrong.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

Here's the truth: we've been winning states - six of the last seven - but =
our fundraising is slowing down a bit this month.

Our historic levels of grassroots support have propelled us to a lot of =
important victories and a path to the nomination. Without it, this =
campaign would have been over months ago. But the next three weeks are the =
most important of our campaign and we need to do very well.

Bernie is traveling the country and speaking at huge rallies. Our field =
offices are humming in every state with a coming caucus or primary.

The rest is up to you. If we have the resources to win, we will win.

You made a $3 contribution earlier in the campaign, if you match that =
donation today, we will have the resources we need to win this primary. =
It's asking a lot, but those are the stakes:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/the-rest-is-up-to-you

What we are proving on this campaign is that you can get elected without =
hustling millionaires and billionaires for money. This campaign is funded =
by individual contributions coming in response to emails like this one. =
There are no oligarchs waiting in the wings. As you go, we go. That's why =
your contribution is so important.

In solidarity,

Here's the truth: ever since we won Wisconsin, the Clinton campaign has =
gone HARD NEGATIVE against Bernie as part of the plan to "disqualify him, =
defeat him" and unify the party later.

Why? Because we're winning primaries and caucuses by dramatic margins, and =
those victories have opened up a clear path to the nomination. And we have =
a chance to do very well in Wyoming later this afternoon.

They didn't expect that, so they're throwing the kitchen sink at us. Her =
campaign has scheduled and held FIFTEEN fundraisers in the first 7 days of =
April, and they're spending big in New York, a state she led by 48 points =
four weeks ago. The head of her coordinated super PAC compared Bernie to =
Donald Trump, and one of Clinton's top surrogates in New York called =
Bernie a "socialist" with a "quest for power" who is not qualified to be =
commander-in-chief.

But that's ok - the Clinton campaign's attacks only remind people of the =
kind of politics the American people are rejecting through our campaign. =
If we keep fighting, we're going to keep winning, no matter how negative =
they get.

Make a $3 contribution to Bernie's campaign today. This is THE MOST =
IMPORTANT three weeks of this campaign. So donate today and know that =
you've done everything you can to win this campaign:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/these-next-3-weeks

We have two choices in these next three weeks. We can either continue to =
fight for the values we share: universal health care, reducing income =
inequality, protecting our environment, and transforming our corrupt =
campaign finance system. Or we will come up short.

Bernie is traveling the country and speaking at huge rallies. Our field =
offices are humming in every state with a coming caucus or primary.

The rest is up to you. If we have the resources to win, we will. That's =
why your $3 matters so much. It's the difference between victory and =
defeat:

Thank you for renewing your commitment to our campaign today.

	Here&rsquo;s the truth: <strong>ever since we won Wisconsin, the Clinton =
campaign has gone HARD NEGATIVE against Bernie</strong> as part of the =
plan to "disqualify him, defeat him" and unify the party later.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	Why? Because we&rsquo;re winning primaries and caucuses by dramatic =
margins, and those victories have opened up a clear path to the =
nomination. And we have a chance to do very well in Wyoming later this =
afternoon.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	They didn&rsquo;t expect that, so they&rsquo;re throwing the kitchen sink =
at us. Her campaign has scheduled and held FIFTEEN fundraisers in the =
first <a href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">7 days =
of April</a>, and they&rsquo;re spending big in New York, a state she led =
by 48 points <a href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: =
#364350;">four weeks ago</a>. The head of her coordinated super PAC =
compared Bernie to Donald Trump, and one of Clinton&rsquo;s top surrogates =
in New York called Bernie a &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; with a &ldquo;quest =
for power&rdquo; who is not qualified to be commander-in-chief.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	<strong>But that&rsquo;s ok &ndash; the Clinton campaign&rsquo;s attacks =
only remind people of the kind of politics the American people are =
rejecting through our campaign.</strong> If we keep fighting, we&rsquo;re =
going to keep winning, no matter how negative they get.</p>

Sisters and Brothers -

We just got word that we won Wyoming's caucus and a majority of the =
state's delegates. This is huge.

This momentum is just what we need in order to win New York's crucial =
primary in 10 days. But we also must know that the billionaire class is =
more scared than ever, and they don't want to see us win again. They want =
to stop us here and now.

Contribute $2.70 to our campaign and we can keep our momentum going with =
another huge victory in New York. Your investment today in our movement =
will go a long way to taking back our country from the billionaire class:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/wyoming-win

Momentum is winning eight out of the last nine contests while bringing =
more and more voters and young people to our side as we talk about income =
inequality, climate change, universal health care, and our corrupt =
campaign finance system.

Momentum is proving again and again to the political and economic =
establishment that you don't need to have a super PAC in order to win the =
presidency.

This momentum is incredible - but you'll never imagine what our momentum =
can be if we win New York's primary.

Contribute $2.70 to our campaign and we can win New York's primary, win =
the Democratic nomination, win the White House, and take back our country =
from the billionaire class:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/wyoming-win

Thanks for being with us.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

You may not know how powerful you are, sisters and brothers, but you are =
incredibly powerful.

You are powerful enough to convince a former secretary of state to change =
her mind about matters as important as international trade and global =
climate change.

You are powerful enough that some of the wealthiest people in the world =
are prepared to spend billions of dollars to stop you.

You are powerful enough to win 16 of the first 34 states against the most =
inevitable candidate in modern political history.

Our power comes from a simple, timeless truth: when people come together, =
there is nothing we cannot accomplish.

And your $3 contribution -- along with thousands of others being made =
right now -- is powerful enough to help win the New York primary, the =
Democratic primary, and the White House in November:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/you-are-powerful

This is the single most important two-week stretch of this Democratic =
primary and I know that if we continue to stand together and fight, we are =
going to win.

This is our moment.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

If there's one thing people know about Bernie Sanders, it's that he's not =
for sale.

No number of bankers can stop Bernie from breaking up the banks.

No amount of fossil fuel lobbyists can bundle enough money to stop Bernie =
from opposing fracking and doing everything in his power to fight climate =
change.

There aren't enough Big Pharma CEOs in the world to stop Bernie from =
getting universal health care.

Bernie's not for sale. But that means he needs you.

Add your $3 contribution now to Bernie's campaign to show the political =
establishment that our movement can't be bought:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/bernies-not-for-sale

Every time someone contributes to our campaign, it's a message the =
billionaire class hears loud and clear. That has them very nervous. Let's =
keep them on their toes.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

I think that many in the media who are covering our campaign forget where =
we came from.

Today they are covering the fact that we have won eight of the last nine =
contests, and are building for a significant election in New York. They =
hang on our every word, and breathlessly report on the campaign like it's =
a baseball game or soap opera.

This is very different from where we were when we started this campaign =
less than a year ago. We were dismissed as a "fringe" campaign, one that =
few thought had a chance, and one to which not many in the media paid much =
attention.

The difference? Your support.

Your $3 contribution, paired with millions like it, is the difference in =
this election. It's because of your support that this election is now =
about raising the minimum wage, fighting climate change, and taking back =
our country from the billionaire class:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/easy-to-forget

We have only come this far because we have millions of supporters, =
millions of votes, and millions of donations. This is a campaign powered =
by people, much to the chagrin of the billionaire class and the dismay of =
the media.

Almost a year ago, we were lucky to have a handful of reporters cover our =
events. But then something started happening: as our supporters told their =
friends and family about what we're doing, we started to catch fire.

In the face of one of the best-organized political machines in modern =
American history, we are doing what no one thought possible: winning. =
Let's keep winning in New York's primary.

Add a $3 contribution now and help us continue this incredible momentum:

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

New York has enthusiastically welcomed Bernie back to his childhood home =
with open arms. Well, most of New York. There's one very small part of the =
state that isn't so excited to see him return.

Can you guess where?

An article titled "Jamie Dimon's not-so-subtle warning for Bernie Sanders" =
welcomed our campaign to New York with this message from the Wall Street =
CEO: "Jamie Dimon waved a placard at Bernie Sanders in his annual =
shareholders letter on Wednesday. It says, in effect: 'Don't Bite the Hand =
That Feeds Us.'"

Here's the truth: from day one, Wall Street has contributed more than $21 =
million to Hillary Clinton's campaign and super PACs, and they are going =
to do everything they can to stop us in New York. Because if we can win =
there, we're going to win everywhere. The stakes are high in these next =
two weeks, and that's why we have to ask:

Contribute $2.70 to our campaign today. If everyone who has signed up to =
support this campaign renewed their commitment with a contribution, we =
will have the resources we need to beat Wall Street in the New York =
primary:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-message-from-wall-street

In less than one year, our campaign has received more individual =
contributions than Barack Obama did during the entirety of his historic =
2008 campaign -- almost 7 million so far! But we cannot afford to stop =
now, and it is how we respond in this moment that could be the difference =
between victory and defeat for our political revolution. That's why your =
contribution is so important.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

I need to share a story with you, sisters and brothers. It will probably =
anger you, but hopefully it will also inspire you to take action in =
support of one of the most courageous people I've met during this =
campaign.

Lucy Flores was the first Latina assemblywoman in Nevada and made national =
news when she became one of the first elected officials to testify about =
an abortion she had at the age of 16.

During her 2014 campaign one D.C. pro-choice group, EMILY's List, endorsed =
her and added that she was an "inspiring community leader." They even =
kicked off a program to elect more Latinas to Congress in 2016.

But then Lucy Flores endorsed our political revolution before the Nevada =
caucus, and everything changed. EMILY's List decided to endorse a =
different person in Lucy's House race this time around. So I want to =
support Lucy like she's supported us, because we stand together. And I am =
asking you to join me:

Split a $2.70 contribution between our campaign and Lucy Flores today and =
send a powerful message that we are going to win this primary AND elect a =
Congress willing to stand up to the political establishment and =
billionaire class of this country:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lucy-flores-for-congress

Throughout this campaign, I've told you that no candidate for president - =
not Bernie Sanders, not the greatest president you could possibly imagine =
- can take on the billionaire class alone.

Lucy Flores is exactly the kind of person I'm going to need in Congress =
when I am president. And we can help get her there. That's why your =
contribution is so important.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

When we talk about a political revolution, sisters and brothers, we also =
need to have people in Congress who aren't beholden to special interests.

That's why I want you to meet Zephyr Teachout, who's running for Congress =
in New York as a Democrat.

Zephyr literally wrote the book on political corruption. She understands =
better than anybody how special interests try to buy off politicians, and =
she's dedicated her life to fixing our broken political system.

Zephyr is exactly the kind of person I'd want in Congress when I'm =
president. That's why I'm asking you directly:

Split a $2.70 contribution to Bernie 2016 and to Zephyr Teachout to make =
sure we have people in Congress who can stand up to special interests and =
do what's right for working people:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/zephyr-teachout-for-congress

Zephyr's not just against fracking - she worked hand-in-hand with =
anti-fracking activists to help stop it in New York State.

She's not just against political corruption - she's led organizations to =
fight the influence of money in politics and to break up the banks too.

And now that she's running for Congress, she's doing it with a grassroots =
movement, with more than 10,000 donors to her campaign in just a few =
months.

Zephyr is the real deal. Can you help her with a contribution?

Contribute $2.70 to help win the White House and elect Zephyr Teachout to =
Congress. Let's put a whole political revolution in power:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/zephyr-teachout-for-congress

Thanks for being a part of our movement.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Yesterday the CEO of Verizon said that I was "contemptible." He doesn't =
like that yesterday I walked the picket line with striking Verizon =
workers, or that I think Verizon needs to pay its fair share in taxes.

Verizon's attack reminded me of what President Franklin Delano Roosevelt =
said in New York City in 1936:

"We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace -- business and =
financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, =
sectionalism, war profiteering.
"They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere =
appendage to their own affairs. We know now that Government by organized =
money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob.
"Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against =
one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me =
-- and I welcome their hatred."
Like FDR, I welcome the contempt of Verizon's CEO. I welcome the hatred =
and contempt of every Wall Street banker, hedge fund manager, =
pharmaceutical lobbyist and fracking executive trying to stop our =
campaign.

They know how powerful we are when we stand together. That's why I need to =
ask you directly.

If everyone who has signed up to support our campaign made a $2.70 =
contribution right now, it would ensure we have the resources we need to =
win New York's primary on Tuesday night. Make yours here.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/contempt

I visited FDR's gravesite this week while I was campaigning in New York. I =
took the time to reflect on his presidency, and how he stood up to the =
powerful interests on Wall Street who wrecked the nation's economy and =
sent our country spiraling into the Great Depression.

FDR thought big. When people said that Social Security was impossible, he =
defied them and created the safety net we have today. When people told him =
that he couldn't rein in Wall Street greed, he signed the Glass-Steagall =
Act into law.

Today we are thinking big, and the billionaire class is telling us what =
we're doing is impossible. People keep underestimating us, and we keep =
proving them wrong. Let's show them again on Tuesday in New York's =
primary.

Make a $2.70 contribution right now and we will have the resources we need =
to win New York's primary on Tuesday night.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/contempt

I'm going to be on stage for tonight's Democratic debate in a feww hours, =
and I know that with your support, we can win.

Nothing is impossible.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

I just got off the debate stage, and I hope you had the chance to watch.

We talked about some of the big differences in this campaign: I support a =
$15 minimum wage, Secretary Clinton does not. I have a plan to achieve =
universal health care as a right for every man, woman and child in =
America, Secretary Clinton does not. I have been fighting to hold Wall =
Street accountable for their greed, recklessness and fraud, Secretary =
Clinton has been taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from Goldman =
Sachs for paid speeches.

In five days New York votes, and we are doing everything we can to win. If =
we continue to fight, and turnout is high, I think we will. And that's why =
I have to ask:

Can I count on you to make a $2.70 contribution right now? Thousands of =
supporters are responding to tonight's debate with donations. With five =
days left before New York votes, it is so important that you add yours =
right now.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/new-york-debate

This is the most important stretch of our campaign. We have won eight of =
the last nine caucuses and primaries, but the result in New York this =
Tuesday and the five states voting the week after will go a long way =
toward determining whether or not our political revolution wins this =
Democratic primary, the White House, and takes our country back from the =
billionaire class. That's why your contribution is so important.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	We talked about some of the big differences in this campaign: I support a =
$15 minimum wage, Secretary Clinton does not. I have a plan to achieve =
universal health care as a right for every man, woman and child in =
America, Secretary Clinton does not. I have been fighting to hold Wall =
Street accountable for their greed, recklessness and fraud, Secretary =
Clinton has been taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from Goldman =
Sachs for paid speeches.</p>

important that you add yours right now.</strong></a></p>
<p>

<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	This is the most important stretch of our campaign. We have won eight of =
the last nine caucuses and primaries, but the result in New York <a =

Tuesday</a> and the five states voting the week after will go a long way =

We had one of the most incredible moments of our campaign on Wednesday =
night. More than 27,000 people came out for our rally in New York City -- =
it was HUGE.

This is what a political revolution looks like. This is the momentum we =
need going into New York's primary on Tuesday. Let's make sure we win.
If everyone who has signed up to support our campaign made a $2.70 =
contribution right now, it would ensure we have the resources we need to =
win New York's primary on Tuesday night. Make yours here:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/new-york-rally

If we stand together now, we can win the Democratic nomination and the =
White House. Let's go.

Sisters and Brothers -

Tonight, Hillary Clinton is hosting a fundraiser at the home of a =
California venture capitalist where couples contributing $353,000 get to =
sit at a table with George Clooney.

Now, you know where this campaign stands on George Clooney. YUGE fans. But =
a political contribution of $353,000?!??! That's just an obscene amount of =
money.

And while the Clinton campaign repeatedly claims this money to her =
"Victory Fund" goes toward supporting the DNC, campaign finance records =
show they've spent millions of those dollars to subsidize their own =
campaign. It is, let's just say, a very creative way to use enormous =
checks from people like Alice Walton (yes, Wal-Mart) to cover what would =
otherwise be campaign expenses.

So, we've set another ambitious goal, because that's what this campaign is =
about: setting ambitious goals and watching people come together to meet =
them. Here it is:

Help Bernie raise $353,000 before midnight. Not in a single check, but in =
$3.53 increments. Add your contribution to the thousands being made right =
now:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/353400?refcode=3Dem160415-v1

New York votes in just four days, and we have a chance to shock the world =
right in Hillary Clinton's backyard. Over 19,000 people came to see Bernie =
at a rally in the Bronx. Then 27,000 joined him at Washington Square Park. =
And last night chants of Bernie! Bernie! Bernie! echoed through the debate =
venue after Bernie's closing remarks. We can do this. Maybe not in =
$353,000 chunks, but $3.53 at a time.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

Dear Bernie Supporter,

We're just five days out from the New York primary. This is an =
all-hands-on-deck moment, so we're setting a huge and ambitious goal that =
could be the difference between victory and defeat: calling two million =
voters over the weekend.

To reach our goal, we need 15,000 of you to sign up to call New York =
voters for at least an hour this Saturday or Sunday.

48 hours. 15,000 volunteers. Two million calls. Are you in?

YES, I'LL HELP BERNIE WIN NEW YORK
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/takenybyphone?source=3Demt160414

If we reach 15,000 callers between Saturday and Sunday, we estimate we'll =
make more than a million calls a day, which is yuuuuge. In fact, as far as =
we can tell, this could be the biggest virtual phonebank ever!

We'll be honest: this is such an ambitious goal that we might not reach =
it. But this campaign is, after all, about doing big things. And if enough =
of us get on the phones this weekend, Tuesday could deliver yet another =
historic upset victory for Bernie.

Sign up to call New York: =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/takenybyphone?source=3Demt160414

If you've never made phone calls to voters before, don't worry. It's easy. =
All you need is a computer or a tablet and a phone. There's a simple =
script for you to follow, and there are volunteers standing by on livechat =
to help if you get stuck.=20
Right now, in lower Manhattan, the Wall Street bankers, corporate media =
types, and Democratic party establishment figures are hoping you'll sit =
this fight out. They know that a win in New York would put us in a strong =
position to win the nomination - and threaten the entire rigged system =
that benefits them personally.

Let's show them that we too know how high the stakes are -- by setting a =
historic record right before Tuesday's vote. Sign up to call New York:
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/takenybyphone?source=3Demt160414

In solidarity,

Team Bernie

Dear Friend,

New York voters go to the polls on Tuesday. This is a very important =
moment for our campaign.

We've set a very audacious goal for this weekend: 15,000 volunteers making =
2 million calls into New York. Can we count on your help for an hour or =
two this weekend?

YES, I'LL CALL NEW YORK VOTERS NOW:
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/nyphonebank/

I CAN MAKE CALLS LATER TODAY OR TOMORROW:
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/takenybyphone?source=3Dem160416

If you've been on the fence, NOW is the time to get involved. We think =
this will be the largest phonebank event in history, and we need you to be =
a part of it.

If you've never made phone calls to voters before, don't worry. It's easy. =
All you need is a computer or a tablet, and a phone. There's a simple =
script for you to follow, and volunteers standing by on livechat to help =
if you get stuck.

A win on Tuesday will shock the establishment, prove we can win anywhere, =
and move us down the path to the nomination. So don't miss out on your =
chance to play a big role in American political history - either by =
calling New York voters now:  =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/nyphonebank/

.... or signing up to call later today or tomorrow: =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/takenybyphone?source=3Dem160416

In solidarity,

Team Bernie

Does this sound familiar to you, sisters and brothers?

"The corporations and special interests have their voice in Congress, and =
they have too many members scared of their power. What Congress needs is a =
progressive voice who is unafraid to take on these powerful interests - =
who is willing to fight for all Americans, not just the wealthiest 1 =
percent."
That's how Pramila Jayapal announced she was running for Congress. Pramila =
is exactly the kind of person I'm going to need in Congress when I am =
president. Let's help make sure she gets there.

Split a $2.70 contribution to Bernie 2016 and Pramila Jayapal so we can =
put our whole political revolution in power this November:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/pramila-jayapal-for-congress

When you think about our political revolution, sisters and brothers, I =
want you to think of Pramila Jayapal.

Pramila helped lead the fight for paid sick leave and a $15 minimum wage =
in Seattle. She's not afraid to take on powerful special interests. She's =
fought for immigrant rights, opposed the war in Iraq, and worked to =
protect Social Security.

She's also running her campaign with our political revolution. It's a =
people-powered movement that will change how campaigns are run -- one the =
political establishment doesn't really like to see.

I'm asking you to add a contribution to Pramila Jayapal because she's a =
progressive leader and Congress needs more voices like hers. Will you join =
me?

Split a $2.70 contribution to our campaign and to Pramila Jayapal and take =
our political revolution to the White House and to Congress:

We talk a lot about the average contribution to our campaign, sisters and =
brothers. Do you know what it is?

It's $27. (Of course you knew that. It's just so fun to say.)

We think $27 is so important because it stands in such stark contrast to =
how seemingly everyone else runs for president: huge contributions from =
the billionaire class, lobbyists bundling hundreds of thousands of =
dollars, or, as Hillary Clinton is did last night, hosting dinners with a =
top price tag of $353,400.

So while Hillary Clinton hosted her $353,400 dinner tonight in San =
Francisco, we're ran an ad on TV to tell San Francisco voters that we do =
things differently. We're doing it again tonight in Los Angeles during =
another big fundraiser. The ad is called "$27."

Watch our new ad about how our campaign is powered by $27 contributions, =
and chip in your own $27 to continue this critical work to challenge our =
corrupt campaign finance system.

WATCH THE AD & CHIP IN $27: =
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/27-ad

It seems like everyone knows what our average contribution is. Even at =
last night's debate, the audience shouted "TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS" before =
Bernie could finish his sentence about the average contribution to our =
campaign.

More than 2 million people have contributed almost 7 million times because =
they want to make Bernie Sanders our next president. At an average of $27 =
apiece, we are showing that there is another way to run campaigns - one =
that cuts out the billionaire class. They don't like that very much, and =
that's why they're trying to stop us.

Contribute $27 to our campaign right now to show the political and =
financial establishment that we can compete with their corrupt campaign =
finance system - and that we can win:

Sisters and Brothers -

Remember that Hillary Clinton fundraiser on Friday where a couple could =
contribute $353,000 to sit at a table with George Clooney? Well, George =
Clooney himself was asked on NBC whether that was an obscene amount of =
money, and here's what he said:

"It is an obscene amount of money, the Sanders campaign when they talk =
about it is absolutely right. It's ridiculous that we have this kind of =
money in politics." - George Clooney

Here's the truth: you cannot change a corrupt campaign finance system by =
taking its money. That's what this election is about: tearing down a =
system where big money props up the institutions that rig the economy =
against ordinary Americans. And the central question of our campaign is =
can 99% of Americans defeat the 1% trying to maintain the status quo? =
That's why we have to ask:

Contribute $2.70 to Bernie's campaign today to help us win New York and as =
a way of saying you have had ENOUGH of millionaires and billionaires =
buying our campaigns and elections.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/thank-you-george-clooney

This is without question that most important week of our campaign. New =
York votes Tuesday and five states follow one week later. How we step up =
and respond in this moment could very well mean the difference between =
victory and defeat for our political revolution.

In solidarity,

Here we come, sisters and brothers. One month ago, we were down 48 points =
in New York. With just two days to go until the primary, we've cut the =
lead in Hillary Clinton's home state all the way down to six.

Gravis Poll - New York Democratic Primary
Hillary Clinton: 53%
Bernie Sanders: 47%

Here's the truth: we don't have to win New York on Tuesday, but we have to =
pick up a lot of delegates. This poll shows that if we keep fighting, we =
may actually have a chance to do both. It'd be the most shocking upset in =
modern political history. That's why we have to ask:

Right now, thousands of people are making $2.70 contributions to Bernie's =
campaign. If you add yours we are going to have the resources to win New =
York, the Democratic primary, and take our country back from the =
billionaire class.

The political establishment was in shock after last week's debate. Can you =
imagine their panic if we do well on Tuesday night? And we can, but only =
if we keep fighting against the millionaires and billionaires funding =
Hillary Clinton's campaign.

Last night, while we were holding our largest rally of the campaign, a top =
Clinton surrogate told a much smaller audience that Hillary Clinton was =
under attack, and her supporters needed to "stand up and fight back, stand =
up against those idealists."

Let me tell you something, sisters and brothers: there is nothing we have =
said in this campaign that is pie-in-the-sky, that is utopian. Nothing.

We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world, and we can =
create an economy where nobody who works 40 hours a week lives in poverty, =
where health care is a right for all Americans, and where kids of all =
backgrounds can go to college without crushing debt.

When we launched this campaign, I told everyone they should not =
underestimate us and that we were running to win. They thought we were =
pie-in-the-sky then, too. But tomorrow we have a chance to win yet again =

There's something I need to share with you, and it's probably going to =
anger you. It should probably anger everyone. Here it is:

The Clinton campaign is bending campaign finance rules to their breaking =
point all so Wall Street fat cats and people like Alice Walton can =
contribute 130 times the legal limit to support her campaign. All to =
defeat us in the primary.

You already know about the fundraiser Hillary Clinton held where a couple =
could contribute $353,000 to sit at a table with George Clooney. That =
money doesn't go directly to the Clinton campaign, it goes to something =
called the "Hillary Victory Fund" - another account that has raised almost =
$35 million.

Well, for MONTHS the Clinton campaign has been saying the primary purpose =
of that fund is to support the DNC and state parties. But that's not even =
close to true.

According to the Hillary Victory Fund's most recent FEC report, 80 percent =
of the money they spent in 2016 - $25 MILLION - went directly towards =
helping the Clinton campaign itself.

So, what can we do about it? We can either sit back and shrug our =
shoulders at yet another obscene injustice. Or, we can fight. I say we =
fight.

Contribute $2.70 to Bernie's campaign today to help us win New York and as =
a way of saying you have had ENOUGH of the way Hillary Clinton's campaign =
is funding its campaign and super PACs.

https://go.berniesanders.com/we-must-keep-fighting

So, this is distressing, but it's probably to be expected. The Clinton =
campaign has raised the majority of its money from people giving the =
maximum amount of money under the law and her super PACs have raised more =
than $15 million from Wall Street alone.

Do you believe we can change a corrupt system by taking its money? Bernie =
Sanders says no, and that's the choice New Yorkers face on Tuesday.

The choice you face right now, is are you willing to contribute $2.70 to =
fight back and win this primary, the White House and take our country back =
from the billionaire class? You can do that here:

https://go.berniesanders.com/we-must-keep-fighting

This is the most important week and a half of the campaign. How we respond =
in this moment could mean the difference between victory and defeat.

In solidarity,

Bernie Supporter,

Last week, when we asked for 15,000 of you to call New York, we honestly =
weren't sure if we could hit that target. But Sunday night when we ran the =
numbers, we found that you smashed through our original goal of two =
million calls, and put more than THREE million calls into New York in just =
two days.

That is simply incredible! And it could make a huge difference today. But =
we can't stop now. Despite a ton of on-the-ground momentum, Bernie is =
still down a few points in the polls this morning as New Yorkers head out =
to vote.

URGENT: we need 7,500 of you on the phones for one hour today to make sure =
Bernie supporters in New York get out to vote. If 7,500 of you get on the =
phones for at least one hour, we'll put another million calls into New =
York when it counts the most - on primary day.

YES, I WILL CALL BERNIE SUPPORTERS NOW TO HELP WIN NEW YORK:
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/nyphonebank/

An upset victory in New York would be game-changing for this primary and =
this movement, and put us on a path to win the nomination and the White =
House. We know we have the grassroots support to pull it off, but the =
critical challenge is getting Bernie's supporters to the polls. Your calls =
today could literally mean the difference between winning and losing =
tonight.

Call New Yorkers now and help turn Bernie supporters out to vote:
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/nyphonebank/

In solidarity,

Team Bernie

Here's the truth, sisters and brothers: since the start of this campaign, =
a majority of the money raised by the Clinton campaign has come from =
people giving the maximum amount allowable.

On our side, something happened that no one ever expected. Millions of =
people came together giving an average of $27 at a time to our campaign, =
and we actually started raising more money than the most inevitable =
candidate ever. Not even Wall Street could keep up!

So, as we got closer to the primaries and caucuses, the Clinton campaign =
had a problem - how were they going to deal with this? They responded as =
you'd think: they asked the richest of the rich (think Walmart's Alice =
Walton) to contribute $353,400 to something called the "Hillary Victory =
Fund," and the majority of the money the "Fund" has spent has gone to =
support the Clinton campaign in the form of cash transfers, advertising, =
and efforts to attract new donors. Tens of millions of dollars put to use =
to try to defeat us in a primary.

It's an arrangement that stretches campaign finance rules to the breaking =
point or beyond. But it's what we are facing in New York tonight and in =
five states next week. And that's why we have to ask:

Contribute $3.53 (1/100,000th of what Alice Walton contributed to the =
Hillary Victory Fund) to help Bernie Sanders win New York, five states =
next week, and send a powerful message that you have had ENOUGH of =
billionaires buying elections.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/what-our-campaign-is-up-against

What makes this worse, honestly, is the way the Clinton campaign has =
touted the "Hillary Victory Fund" as a tool to benefit the DNC and state =
parties.

We've heard it on television, in debates, and they've used it as a line of =
attack against Bernie repeatedly. But now, that turns out not to be true.

Because of reporting timelines, it wasn't even clear until this week just =
how much of the money they've been claiming is going to elect Democrats =
has actually been spent trying to defeat us. And we won't know again for =
another three months how much more of that money they're going to try and =
use to beat us in New York, five states next week, and the huge delegate =
haul on June 7.

That's why we have to ask:

Contribute $3.53 (1/100,000th of what Alice Walton contributed to the =
Hillary Victory Fund) to help Bernie Sanders win New York, five states =
next week, and send a powerful message that you have had ENOUGH of =
billionaires buying elections.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/what-our-campaign-is-up-against

This campaign has accomplished more than anyone could have ever imagined =
when it comes to taking on the corrupting influence of money in politics. =
Now it seems we have to do even more.

Sisters and Brothers -

When we started this campaign, we were down almost 50 points in New York =
-- the state where Hillary Clinton was elected to two terms in the U.S. =
Senate.

We didn't get the victory we had hoped for this evening, but what's =
important is that it looks like we're going to win a lot more delegates in =
New York than any state that voted or caucused before tonight.

So what does that mean? Five important states vote one week from tonight, =
with more delegates at stake than Hillary Clinton led by coming into =
tonight. And if we do well next Tuesday, we remain in a position to take =
the pledged delegate lead when almost 700 delegates are up for grabs on =
June 7.

As you read this, thousands of supporters are responding to tonight's =
results with contributions because they believe we can win. I need to know =
if I can count on you to add yours.

If everybody who has signed up to support our campaign made a $2.70 =
contribution tonight, we will have the resources we need to do very well =
next week and to take the pledged delegate lead on June 7.

>From the day we started this campaign, the corporate media counted us out. =
The political establishment and financial elite organized against us. But =
every great movement in American history faced many of the same obstacles =
and eventually won because of a simple, timeless human truth: when people =
come together, when they stand together even through adversity, they win.

And so will we.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

When we started this campaign, I emailed my supporters and said, "This =
campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It's about a grassroots movement of =
Americans standing up and saying: 'Enough is enough. This country and our =
government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.'"

I believe that now more than ever.

We still have a path to the nomination, and our plan is to win the pledged =
delegates in this primary. Next week five states vote, and there are A LOT =
of delegates up for grabs. I am going to keep fighting for every vote, for =
every delegate, because each is a statement of support for the values we =
share. That's why I have to ask:

Can I count on you to add a $2.70 contribution to our campaign - right now =
- to help us win this primary and as a way of saying you will never stop =
fighting for the ideas that have powered our political revolution?

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-are-at-a-moment-of-truth

The truth is that if we stand together, there is no limit to what we can =
accomplish. We can bring hope to the political process. We can make real =
change. People should not underestimate us.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Subject: Are you with me?

Sisters and Brothers -

I am writing to inform you that I will be a candidate for President of the =
United States. I ask for your support.

Add your $2.70 contribution in support of our campaign.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-are-at-a-moment-of-truth

For many months I have been traveling from coast to coast across our =
country, and have had the opportunity to meet with thousands of good, =
hard-working, and remarkable people. Like you and me, they are deeply =
concerned about the future of our country.

They wonder why they are working longer hours for lower wages. They worry =
about whether their kids will be able to afford college or get decent =
jobs. They fear that they may not have the savings to retire with dignity =
and security.

The challenges facing our country are enormous.

It's not just that, for forty years, the middle class has been =
disappearing. It's that 99% of all new income is going to the top 1%, and =
the grotesque level of wealth and income inequality today is worse than at =
any time since the late 1920s. The people at the top are grabbing all the =
new wealth and income for themselves, and the rest of America is being =
squeezed and left behind.

The disastrous decisions of the Supreme Court in the Citizens United case =
and in other related decisions are undermining the very foundations of =
American democracy, as billionaires rig the system by using their Super =
PACs to buy politicians and elections.

And the peril of global climate change, with catastrophic consequences, is =
the central challenge of our times and our planet.

The middle class in America is at a tipping point. It will not last =
another generation if we don't boldly change course now.

After a year of travel, discussion and dialogue, I have decided to be a =
candidate for the Democratic nomination for president. But let's be clear. =
This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It's about a grassroots =
movement of Americans standing up and saying: "Enough is enough. This =
country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of =
billionaires."

Our movement needs people like you involved to help it succeed. Add your =
$2.70 contribution in support of our campaign.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-are-at-a-moment-of-truth

I run not to oppose any man or woman, but to propose new and far-reaching =
policies to deal with the crises of our times. And I run because I know we =
must change course now, or risk losing the future for so many to the =
interests of so few.

A successful national campaign is a massive undertaking, especially when =
we will be heavily outspent. It will require the active participation of =
millions of Americans in every community in our country. In fact, it will =
require nothing less than a political revolution which combats the =
demoralization and alienation of so many of our people from the political =
process.

Let me be very honest. It may be too late to stop the billionaire class =
from trying to buy the Presidency and Congress. The forces of greed =
already may be too powerful.

But we owe it to our children and grandchildren to try. We owe it to them =
to make the fight and, through the power of our numbers, turn back this =
assault on the foundation of our democracy and our future.

We are at a moment of truth. We need to face up to the reality of where we =
are as a nation, and we need a mass movement of people to fight for =
change.

I believe America is ready for a new path to the future.

On May 26th I will formally launch our campaign at the City Hall in =
Burlington, Vermont, where I served as Mayor.

I ask you to join with me in our campaign for President of the United =
States.

Sincerely,

Senator Bernie Sanders

concerned about the future of our country.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	They wonder why they are working longer hours for lower wages. They worry =
about whether their kids will be able to afford college or get decent =
jobs. They fear that they may not have the savings to retire with dignity =
and security.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	The challenges facing our country are enormous.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	It's not just that, for forty years, the middle class has been =
disappearing. It's that 99% of all new income is going to the top 1%, and =
the grotesque level of wealth and income inequality today is worse than at =
any time since <a href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: =
#364350;">the late 1920s</a>. The people at the top are grabbing all the =
new wealth and income for themselves, and the rest of America is being =
squeezed and left behind.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	The disastrous decisions of the Supreme Court in the Citizens United case =
and in other related decisions are undermining the very foundations of =
American democracy, as billionaires rig the system by using their Super =
PACs to buy politicians and elections.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	And the peril of global climate change, with catastrophic consequences, =
is the central challenge of our times and our planet.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	The middle class in America is at a tipping point. It will not last =
another generation if we don&rsquo;t boldly change course now.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	<strong>After a year of travel, discussion and dialogue, I have decided =
to be a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president.</strong> =
But let's be clear. This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It's about =
a grassroots movement of Americans standing up and saying: "Enough is =
enough. This country and our government belong to all of us, not just a =
handful of billionaires."</p>

which combats the demoralization and alienation of so many of our people =
from the political process.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	Let me be very honest. It may be too late to stop the billionaire class =

Dear Bernie Supporter,

New York wasn't the result we were looking for. But we still have a path =
to the nomination, and our plan is to win the pledged delegates in this =
primary.

Let's be clear: we put more than 3 million calls into New York last =
weekend, and turned out a HUGE number of voters for Bernie. They voted for =
Bernie, for his ideas, and for our movement. And for each voter we =
contact, we'll win more states, win more pledged delegates, and win the =
nomination.

This coming Tuesday, five more states vote, with 384 delegates up for =
grabs. We need to win every delegate possible in these contests to take a =
big bite out of our opponent's lead before the primary season moves =
westward.

So we're calling for an all-hands-on-deck mobilization this Saturday =
through Monday to find Bernie supporters in the April 26th states and get =
them out to vote. Will you pitch in?

YES, I'LL GET ON THE PHONES FOR BERNIE THIS WEEKEND
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/the-revolution-is-calling?source=3Dem1=
60421

Our goal for this weekend is 20,000 callers phonebanking on Saturday =
through Monday - which is very ambitious. But if we can hit our goal for =
callers, together we'll make over 3.5 MILLION calls into the states that =
vote next Tuesday, which could make a yuuuge difference in some of these =
races.

Sign up to make some calls this weekend:
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/the-revolution-is-calling?source=3Dem1=
60421

If you've never made phone calls to voters before, don't worry. It's easy. =
All you need is a computer or a tablet and a phone. There's a simple =
script for you to follow, and there are volunteers standing by on livechat =
to help if you get stuck. You can call on your own from anywhere, or click =
here to find a phonebank event with other Bernie supporters near you:
http://map.berniesanders.com/#zipcode=3D03223&amp;distance=3D20&amp;sort=
=3Dtime&amp;f%5B%5D=3Dcampaign-office&amp;f%5B%5D=3Dphonebank

Despite disappointing results from New York - where we were playing on our =
opponent's home turf, and under some of the most onerous voter =
registration requirements in the country - we are going to campaign hard =
until the very last primary votes are cast in June. And every voter we =
call on the phones makes a difference for our delegate count.

When we stand together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish - including =
winning this nomination. So sign up to call for Bernie this weekend and =
keep our political revolution strong.

In solidarity,

Team Bernie

Sisters and Brothers,

The CEO of Verizon makes almost $20 million a year in compensation. He =
leads one of the most profitable companies in the country.

Yet Verizon wants to take away employees' health benefits. Verizon wants =
to outsource decent-paying jobs. Verizon wants to avoid paying federal =
income tax. And right now, Verizon is refusing to sit down and negotiate a =
fair contract with its employees.

In other words, Verizon is just another major American corporation trying =
to destroy the lives of working Americans. But this time, Verizon's =
employees are fighting back.

Thousands of very brave employees of Verizon and Verizon Wireless are on =
strike until they can get a fair contract. They made a very difficult =
decision that puts their families at risk -- but it's a choice they made a =
choice to stand up for justice against corporate greed.

I'm asking you today to stand up and tell the CEO of Verizon that you =
think Verizon employees deserve a fair contract that protects health =
benefits, guarantees fair pay, and stops outsourcing. Click here to add =
your name in support of Verizon employees.

ADD YOUR NAME =C2=BB =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/stand-with-verizon-employees

Twice last week in New York City I walked stood with Verizon workers in =
the streets. I did so because they're doing something very brave: they're =
standing up not just for themselves, but for the millions of Americans who =
don't have a union.

The working class of this country deserves to earn decent wages, decent =
benefits, and not see their jobs go to low wage countries.

Verizon's CEO doesn't think that. He called me "contemptible" for saying =
that his employees need a fair contract, and that Verizon should pay its =
fair share in federal income taxes.

What I think is contemptible is CEOs with multi-million dollar =
compensation packages, presiding over extremely profitable companies, and =
still refusing to give your employees a fair contract.

Corporate greed is a scourge on this country, and it will take all of us =
standing up for justice in order to rein it in. One significant way you =
can stand up to corporate greed is by standing with Verizon employees who =
are out on strike.

Add your name and say you support Verizon employees who are standing up to =
the CEO in order to get a fair contract with health benefits, fair pay, =
and job protections.

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/stand-with-verizon-employees

Corporate America is slowly beginning to realize that they cannot have it =
all. Thanks for helping them know it.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Since our campaign started fifty-one weeks ago, we've been through a lot =
together, sisters and brothers - to say the least. As we've gone =
toe-to-toe with the political establishment, Wall Street, super PACs, and =
the billionaire class, I want to remind you of something.

The media likes to portray this as a fair fight on even footing. They seem =
to forget that when we started our campaign on April 30, we barely =
registered in the polls. We didn't have a political organization, we =
didn't have millionaires waiting in the wings. Quite frankly, we didn't =
have a whole lot. And then millions of people came together in a political =
revolution.

The latest national poll average shows us just 1.4 percent behind =
Secretary Clinton. We've erased a 55-point advantage she once held over =
our campaign. That is really quite something.


Can Bernie count on you to make a $2.70 contribution to our campaign today =
to help us win, and as a way of saying YOU WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING for =
the values we share?

A graph from RealClearPolitics shows our national polling average with =
Bernie at 46.3% and Secretary Clinton at 47.7%. That is something nobody =
ever thought possible. More and more Americans hear about Bernie Sanders, =
and they like what they hear. Let's keep working hard for our political =
revolution.

Bernie Supporter,

It's game time. On Tuesday, five states go to the polls: Connecticut, =
Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania. Combined, there are =
384 pledged delegates at stake. Our goal is simple: win as many as =
possible. Our plan to do it: talk to as many voters as possible.

That's where you come in. Starting tomorrow and going through Monday, =
we're doing something huge: calling 3.5 MILLION voters. It's a tall order =
-- but so is a political revolution to take back our democracy.

YES, I'LL GET ON THE PHONES FOR BERNIE THIS WEEKEND
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/the-revolution-is-calling?source=3Dem1=
60422

As we've seen in past primaries and caucuses, winning comes down to two =
important things: 1) getting Bernie's message out to people who haven't =
heard it yet, and 2) making sure those voters turn up on primary day. When =
you call voters for Bernie, you'll be doing both of those essential =
things, and giving us our best shot at winning a lot of delegates on =
Tuesday.

If you haven't made calls before, don't worry - all you need is a laptop =
or tablet and a phone. There are simple scripts to follow, and if you need =
help there are livechat volunteers standing by to answer your questions.

Yes, I'll sign up to make calls this Saturday, Sunday, or Monday for =
Bernie:

In solidarity,

Team Bernie

Sisters and Brothers -

One of the reasons Bernie has done so well throughout this campaign is =
because he is telling the truth about the reality of American life today. =
And right now, I want to tell you the truth about the reality of this =
race:

You already know that the New York primary was a tough loss. But there are =
five more primaries in less than one week and we are going fight for every =
single vote and every single delegate.

Not just because we are going to do everything we can to win, but because =
every single vote, and every single delegate for Bernie Sanders is a =
declaration of support for the values we share.

Together, we are the most powerful force for change in American politics =
today. Our political revolution has already forced a former U.S. Senator =
and Secretary of State to change her mind on matters as critical as =
international trade, the Keystone Pipeline, and the federal minimum wage. =
And with every vote and every victory, we grow stronger.  That's why I =
have to ask:


Can Bernie count on you to make a $2.70 contribution to our campaign today =
to help us win, and as a way of saying YOU WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING for =
the values we share?

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/a-declaration-of-support

The New York Times reported that just yesterday the Clinton campaign =
"hosted hundreds of bundlers" at a Manhattan hotel to "focus on bolstering =
her fund-raising for the contest against Mr. Sanders." Her millionaire and =
billionaire backers are still fighting, because for them our campaign is =
about more than an election -- our success threatens their way of life. =
That's why the head of Goldman Sachs said Bernie is "dangerous."

He is right. We are dangerous for Wall Street and the billionaire class of =
this country. And with every contribution, every vote, and every delegate, =
we become even more powerful. Thanks why your contribution matters.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

Sisters and Brothers,

The CEO of Verizon makes almost $20 million a year in compensation. He =
leads one of the most profitable companies in the country.

Yet Verizon wants to take away employees' health benefits. Verizon wants =
to outsource decent-paying jobs. Verizon wants to avoid paying federal =
income tax. And right now, Verizon is refusing to sit down and negotiate a =
fair contract with its employees.

In other words, Verizon is just another major American corporation trying =
to destroy the lives of working Americans. But this time, Verizon's =
employees are fighting back.

Thousands of very brave employees of Verizon and Verizon Wireless are on =
strike until they can get a fair contract. They made a very difficult =
decision that puts their families at risk -- but it's a choice they made a =
choice to stand up for justice against corporate greed.

I'm asking you today to stand up and tell the CEO of Verizon that you =
think Verizon employees deserve a fair contract that protects health =
benefits, guarantees fair pay, and stops outsourcing. Click here to add =
your name in support of Verizon employees.

ADD YOUR NAME =C2=BB =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/stand-with-verizon-employees

Twice last week in New York City I walked stood with Verizon workers in =
the streets. I did so because they're doing something very brave: they're =
standing up not just for themselves, but for the millions of Americans who =
don't have a union.

The working class of this country deserves to earn decent wages, decent =
benefits, and not see their jobs go to low wage countries.

Verizon's CEO doesn't think that. He called me "contemptible" for saying =
that his employees need a fair contract, and that Verizon should pay its =
fair share in federal income taxes.

What I think is contemptible is CEOs with multi-million dollar =
compensation packages, presiding over extremely profitable companies, and =
still refusing to give your employees a fair contract.

Corporate greed is a scourge on this country, and it will take all of us =
standing up for justice in order to rein it in. One significant way you =
can stand up to corporate greed is by standing with Verizon employees who =
are out on strike.

Add your name and say you support Verizon employees who are standing up to =
the CEO in order to get a fair contract with health benefits, fair pay, =
and job protections.

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/stand-with-verizon-employees

Corporate America is slowly beginning to realize that they cannot have it =
all. Thanks for helping them know it.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Bernie Supporter -

If you believe in what Bernie stands for, we need you to get on the phones =
and talk to some voters.

On Tuesday, 384 pledged delegates are at stake in five contests. We need =
to win as many of those delegates as possible to keep our movement going =
strong.

We've come from an afterthought in the polls, to where we are now, thanks =
to a lot of hard work from supporters just like you. So please join with =
thousands of other Bernie supporters across America, and put in a few =
hours today or tomorrow to call voters in the states voting Tuesday.

YES, I'LL CALL VOTERS FOR BERNIE NOW:
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/april26/

YES, I CAN MAKE SOME CALLS LATER:
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/the-revolution-is-calling?source=3Dem1=
60424

I CAN'T CALL BUT I'LL CHIP IN $3:
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lets_go_bernie?refcode=3Dem1604=
24

Help us reach our goal and call 3.5 million voters

Calling on our Bernie Dialer is easy, and very efficient. All you need is =
a computer or tablet, and a phone. We provide you with a script to follow, =
and there are volunteers standing by on livechat to answer your questions =
if you get stuck.

Together, we are the most powerful force for change in American politics =
today. And with every vote, every delegate and every victory, we grow =
stronger. Your efforts are essential to winning those votes, so we hope =
you'll stand with us and keep up the fight for the values we believe in.

In solidarity,

Team Bernie

Sisters and Brothers -

Yesterday morning on Meet the Press, Bernie Sanders acknowledged that we =
have a "narrow path to victory," but that we are going to "fight through =
that path."

Tomorrow five states vote. They are big ones, and Bernie is campaigning =
hard. Last night, 14,000 people showed up to see him in New Haven, =
Connecticut. Earlier in the day, 7,000 came to see him in Providence, =
Rhode Island.

At every event, with crowds as large and excited as at any point in this =
campaign, people are telling Bernie to fight. To fight for every last =
delegate, and for every last vote -- not just because they're needed to =
win, but because each one sends an unmistakable message about our =
country's need for transformational change.

So Bernie is going to fight, and he needs you with him, and that's why we =
have to ask:

Can Bernie count on you to contribute $2.70 to our campaign as a way of =
saying you are still with Bernie Sanders and believe that every vote and =
every delegate is an important declaration of support for the values we =
share?

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/the-values-we-share

We have another FEC fundraising deadline in just five days, and everyone =
will be looking to see how many people are willing to keep fighting with =
Bernie so that no one who works 40 hours a week lives in poverty, so =
health care is a right for all Americans, so kids can go to college =
without crushing debt, and to reclaim our democracy from the billionaire =
class.

Your contribution sends a message that you are with Bernie, and will never =
stop fighting for the values we share.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager
Bernie 2016

Sisters and Brothers -

Over the past few days, Hillary Clinton's campaign and some of its top =
supporters have launched an odd new line of attack against people like you =
who stand with Bernie. They are saying that by continuing to campaign and =
fight for every vote, for every delegate, that we are helping Donald =
Trump.

They've used language reserved for traitors to our country, saying we are =
"giving aid and comfort" to Trump. They are emailing supporters with the =
subject line "What Trump loves about Bernie."

Let me be clear, there is one candidate in this Democratic primary who =
Donald Trump said would make a "great president," and it's not Bernie =
Sanders.

Bernie is going to fight through the narrow path we have to the nomination =
because there is also only one candidate who believes health care should =
be a right for everyone in this country, that kids of all backgrounds =
should be able to go to college without crushing debt, and that we cannot =
transform a corrupt system by taking its money.

Can Bernie count on you to contribute $3 to our campaign right now as a =
way of saying you are still with Bernie Sanders and believe that every =
vote and every delegate is an important declaration of support for the =
values we share?

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/values-we-share

Here's the truth: no matter what the Clinton campaign says, there is one =
candidate in this race Donald Trump said would make a great president, and =
another that he would never want to face in November.

And that's because poll after poll after poll shows that he wouldn't stand =
a chance against our political revolution.

So we are going to keep fighting hard for every vote and for every =
delegate. Not just because that's the only way to win this nomination, but =
because we believe the power of our progressive agenda would energize the =
kind of high voter turnout needed to stop Trump. That's why we have to =
ask:

Can Bernie count on you to contribute $3 to our campaign right now as a =
way of saying you are still with Bernie Sanders and believe that every =

People are voting in five primaries today. In just four days, we'll close =
the books on another important FEC fundraising deadline. Everyone's going =
to be watching to see if people are willing to fight for Bernie, and for =
the political revolution. Let's show them we are.

Sisters and Brothers -

The polls are about to close in five states, and we expect to do well in a =
number of them. As you watch the results, I want you to keep something =
very important in mind. We are running a historic campaign which is =
transforming America.

Any victories and any votes we receive tonight, next week in Indiana, and =
in each state moving forward are a public declaration of support for the =
values we share.

Our path to the nomination was never narrower than the day I announced my =
candidacy. I will not stop fighting for an America where no one who works =
40 hours a week lives in poverty, where health care is a right for all =
Americans, where kids of all backgrounds can go to college without =
crushing debt, where there is no bank too big to fail, no banker too =
powerful to jail, and we've reclaimed our democracy from the billionaire =
class.

The political establishment wants us to go away so they can begin their =
march to the center. But we can send a message to them in a language =
they're sure to understand:

Contribute $3 to our campaign today and we are going to keep fighting for =
the nomination while sending an unmistakable message to the political =
establishment about our commitment to the values we share:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/keep-this-in-mind

When we started this campaign, almost a year ago today, people called us =
"fringe." They said our ideas were too radical. But what we have done =
throughout this campaign is show that when people stand together we can =
take on a billionaire class and the candidates they fund. And the message =
you can send today, with your contribution, is that we are going to keep =
fighting.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

Coming out of last night's results, in which we won Rhode Island but came =
up short in four others, I want to pose to you three things that I know to =
be true:

1. Young people - the future of our country - continue to vote for our =
campaign in overwhelming numbers. It's remarkable, and honestly quite =
humbling.

2. When we compete in open primaries that encourage the participation of =
independents, new voters, and young people, we do very well.

3. What remains in front of us is a very narrow path to the nomination. In =
the weeks to come we will be competing in a series of states that are very =
favorable to us - including California. Just like after March 15 - when we =
won 8 of the next 9 contests - we are building tremendous momentum going =
into the convention.

That is the reality of where we are right now, and why we are going to =
fight for every delegate and every vote. It is why I am going to continue =
to speak to voters in every state about the very important issues facing =
our country. Our country cannot afford to stop fighting for a $15 minimum =
wage, to overturn Citizens United, or to get universal health care for =
every man, woman, and child in America.

I'm asking you to help me continue to lead these fights. We have an FEC =
deadline on Saturday and another primary on Tuesday. Every vote we earn =
and every delegate we win is a testament to our ideas, to our movement, to =
our political revolution, and our willingness to take this campaign for =
the Democratic nomination all the way to the convention.

Will you contribute $2.70 to help us continue to speak to voters about the =
incredibly important issues facing our country? Your support right now =
before two big deadlines will send an unmistakable message that our voices =

	Coming out of <a href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: =

up short in four others, I want to pose to you three things that I know to =
be true:</p>
<ol style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;"><li>
		Young people &ndash; the future of our country &ndash; continue to vote =
for our campaign in overwhelming numbers. It's remarkable, and honestly =
quite humbling.</li>
	<br><li>
		When we compete in open primaries that encourage the participation of =
independents, new voters, and young people, we do very well.</li>
	<br><li>
		What remains in front of us is a very narrow path to the nomination. In =
the weeks to come we will be competing in a series of states that are very =
favorable to us &ndash; including California. Just like after <a =
href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">March 15</a> =
&ndash; when we won 8 of the next 9 contests &ndash; we are building =
tremendous momentum going into the convention.</li>
</ol><p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	That is the reality of where we are right now, and why we are going to =
fight for every delegate and every vote. It is why I am going to continue =
to speak to voters in every state about the very important issues facing =
our country. Our country cannot afford to stop fighting for a $15 minimum =
wage, to overturn Citizens United, or to get universal health care for =
every man, woman, and child in America.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	I'm asking you to help me continue to lead these fights. <strong>We have =
an FEC deadline <a href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: =
#364350;">on Saturday</a> and another primary <a href=3D"#" =
style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">on Tuesday</a>. Every vote =
we earn and every delegate we win is a testament to our ideas, to our =
movement, to our political revolution, and our willingness to take this =
campaign for the Democratic nomination all the way to the =
convention.</strong></p>

Sisters and Brothers -

You may not have noticed this, but the bottom of every email we've sent =
since the beginning of this campaign has included the words, "Paid for By =
Bernie 2016." And beneath those, "(not the billionaires)."

Bernie doesn't go around hustling millionaires and billionaires for money. =
Never has. Never will. Can you even imagine the reaction he'd get if he =
tried?

Our campaign to win this primary and transform the Democratic Party has =
always been powered by the people who make up our political revolution. =
And when you see us winning states and capturing large numbers of =
delegates before the convention, it's requests like this that make it =
possible. So we have to ask:

Can Bernie count on you to chip in $2.70 before Saturday's critical FEC =
fundraising deadline as a way of saying you believe political campaigns =
should be powered by people and "not the billionaires"?

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/not_billionaires

Indiana votes in just five days, and we need to send a powerful message =
that you are "Still Sanders." It's not about how much money we raise, but =
how many contributions our supporters make in these final days before our =
fundraising deadline.

All my best,

Jeff Weaver

Sisters and Brothers -

I want you to read this note, sisters and brothers. It's one of thousands =
we've received from people who have contributed to our campaign this week =
urging Bernie to keep fighting for every vote and for every delegate all =
the way through the convention:

"I am a teacher and Bernie is the only candidate that is truly fighting =
for all of us. No other candidate has his platform of universal health =
care, a $15 minimum wage, and the rebuilding of our infrastructure. I will =
be with Bernie as long as he is willing to fight!" - Melissa from =
Massachusetts

We have an important FEC fundraising deadline tomorrow and the entire =
corporate media and political establishment will be looking to see just =
how many of Bernie's supporters are willing to keep fighting for the =
issues that have powered this campaign from the start. That's why we have =
to ask:

If everyone who have signed up to support Bernie chipped in $2.70 before =
our FEC deadline, that would send a powerful message that you will never =
stop fighting for the values we share and ensure we have the resources we =
need to fight for every vote through the convention.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-stories

Here are some more powerful stories we received from donors this week:

Heather from North Carolina wrote, "I am a 42 year old woman with stage IV =
breast cancer and I want to leave the world a better place for my three =
children. I believe Bernie is the man to lead us towards a better future =
for all, not just a few."

Anne from Ohio added, "I believe in Bernie and he represents my values and =
political policies. I will continue to support him and this political =
revolution. Thank you for giving us all a voice."

And Avid from Utah made a contribution along with this note. "I have been =
actively phone banking and contributing almost daily for Bernie. Please do =
NOT give up the fight. Bernie is an inspiration and is giving hope to me =
and my family!"

Add your $2.70 contribution to Heather, Anne, and Avid's before tomorrow =
night and we are going to win a lot of delegates through the remainder of =
this campaign while sending an unmistakable message that our political =
revolution will never stop fighting for the values we share.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-stories

Bernie is going to keep fighting to win every vote and every delegate, not =
just because that's the only way to win a nomination, but because if we =
continue to stand together we can transform the Democratic Party and take =
our country back from the billionaire class.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers -=20

When we started this campaign, I wrote that "I run not to oppose any man =
or woman, but to propose new and far-reaching policies to deal with the =
crises of our times."

I am very good at arithmetic, and I can count delegates. We are behind =
today, but you know what? A path forward still exists. And our job right =
now is not only to transform our country, but the Democratic Party as =
well.

And you need to know that every vote we win going forward and every =
delegate we send to the Democratic convention not only moves us closer to =
the nomination but also moves our party and our country closer to the =
ideas we're fighting for.

Today is a very important day for our political revolution: it's the =
second to last FEC fundraising deadline before the end of the primary. And =
every member of the corporate media and political establishment in this =
country will be looking to see if you're willing to continue this fight =
together. And that's why I have to ask:

If everyone who has signed up to join our political revolution makes a =
$2.70 contribution before our critical midnight FEC fundraising deadline =
and we'll have the resources we need to continue our fight all the way =
through the Democratic primary.
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/april_deadline?refcode=3Dem1604=
30


It's not just about how much money we are able to raise before tonight's =
deadline, but the total number of individual contributions we receive. =
When the corporate media and political establishment look at our FEC =
report, they're going to see every single donation as a continuing =
demonstration of support for the values we share. That's why it's so =
important you add yours before midnight.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

Wow. Ok, we didn't really know what to expect after Bernie's email this =
morning, but one thing is clear: our political revolution is ready, =
willing and able to continue our campaign to transform the Democratic =
Party and to transform our nation.

Over 10,000 people have already contributed to our campaign today, and =
they're continuing to pour in. But we still have a few hours left to go =
before our critical FEC fundraising deadline. It's not just about how much =
money we raise, but how many individuals contribute to say they're Still =
Sanders.

Can Bernie count on you to make a $2.70 contribution for the final FEC =
fundraising deadline before Super Tuesday? You can do that here:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/april_deadline

We have a chance to have more individual contributions to our campaign in =
the month of April than any other candidate in this election, and that =
would send an unmistakable message about the continued strength of our =
political revolution before Indiana votes in three days.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

Sisters and Brothers -

Wow. Ok, we didn't really know what to expect after Bernie's email this =
morning, but one thing is clear: our political revolution is ready, =
willing and able to continue our campaign to transform the Democratic =
Party and to transform our nation.

Over 10,000 people have already contributed to our campaign today, and =
they're continuing to pour in. But we still have a few hours left to go =
before our critical FEC fundraising deadline. It's not just about how much =
money we raise, but how many individuals contribute to say they're Still =
Sanders.

Can Bernie count on you to make a $2.70 contribution for the final FEC =
fundraising deadline before Super Tuesday? You can do that here:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/april_deadline

We have a chance to have more individual contributions to our campaign in =
the month of April than any other candidate in this election, and that =
would send an unmistakable message about the continued strength of our =
political revolution before Indiana votes in three days.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

Let's talk about the state of the race as it stands today, sisters and =
brothers. For us to win the majority of pledged delegates, we need to win =
654 out of the remaining 1,061.

That is 64 percent. It is admittedly a tough hill to climb, but not an =
impossible one. We intend to fight for every vote and delegate remaining, =
starting with tomorrow night's primary in Indiana where recent polling =
shows us well with the margin of error:

NBC - Indiana Primary (April 29)
Clinton: 50%
Sanders: 46%

Winning Indiana tomorrow night would not only cut into Secretary Clinton's =
lead, but it would send a powerful message to the political establishment =
and corporate media who just want this race to end so they can get on with =
the ratings and fundraising bonanza that would be a Clinton v. Trump =
general election. But Bernie is going to keep fighting, and that's why we =
have to ask:

Your contribution before Indiana votes tomorrow night will help us win a =
very important state while sending a powerful message that you are in this =
campaign as long as Bernie continues to fight.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/indiana-poll?refcode=3Dem160502

Let's be clear. It is virtually impossible for Secretary Clinton to win =
all of the pledged delegates she needs to capture the nomination without =
the help of super delegates at the convention. That means every vote we =
receive, every delegate we win between now and July strengthens our hand =
as we get to a contested convention.

Indiana's next. Let's go out and win our 18th state tomorrow night.

In solidarity,

sisters and brothers -=20

I want to share something with you that is probably going to make you =
angry, but then I am going to give you an opportunity to do something =
about it.

For months, you've heard the Clinton campaign endlessly repeat in =
interviews and on social media that they have raised millions and millions =
of dollars for state parties through something called the "Hillary Victory =
Fund." They've even used it as an attack line to insinuate Bernie wasn't =
willing to help down-ballot Democrats.

Well, yesterday morning, thanks to a Politico investigation, we found out =
that less than 1 percent of the $61 million raised by the Victory Fund has =
stayed in state party coffers. And indeed, the majority of the money spent =
by the Victory Fund has gone to benefit Hillary Clinton's primary campaign =
against us. The piece said some state party fundraisers believe they are =
basically acting as "money-laundering conduits."

There's more, but first let me get to the part where you can take action. =
In recent weeks, the Clinton campaign has expressed a lot of interest in =
what is important to Bernie's supporters. Here's your chance to send a =
message about our distaste for big-money in politics:

https://go.berniesanders.com/victory-fund

Here's how the scheme works for the Clinton campaign:

Rich people like Alice Walton of Walmart who have already contributed the =
maximum amount allowable to the Clinton campaign can contribute an =
additional $350,000-plus to the Victory Fund.

The first $33,400 of her contribution is supposed to go the DNC, and the =
rest divided up between participating state parties. But that's not what's =
been happening. The Victory Fund has mostly been doing one of two things =
with Ms. Walton's money:

1. Taking that money and spending it on advertisements and small-dollar =
fundraising solicitations. Then they take all the small-dollar =
contributions and data reaped from Alice Walton's contribution and =
transfer it directly to the Clinton campaign. This tactic is basically a =
way for them to benefit from a contribution much larger than the legal =
limit from Alice Walton.

2. They take Alice Walton's money and transfer it to state parties, who =
then immediately transfer it to the DNC. Often times they do it without =
the state party even knowing because the Clinton campaign controls many of =
the bank accounts involved. So at the end of the day, most of the state =
parties have received exactly $0 from their Victory Fund arrangement.

So, now we that we know the Clinton campaign is taking advantage of state =
parties to skirt fundraising limits on her presidential campaign, it's =
time for her to do the right thing and let the state parties keep their =
fair share of the cash:

Sign our petition calling on the Clinton campaign to stop bending campaign =
finance rules to their breaking point, and immediately transfer all the =
money allowable to the state parties participating in the "Hillary Victory =
Fund."

https://go.berniesanders.com/victory-fund

It's unfortunate that Hillary Clinton has benefited from tens of millions =
of dollars in cash transfers and advertising to campaign against us in the =
primary. But it's not too late for her campaign to do the right thing by =
the state parties we're going to need to win elections up and down the =
ticket this November.

I'm sure if you sign our petition, that is something they will notice.

In solidarity,

sisters and brothers -=20

Moments ago the news networks declared us the winner of yet another state =
- our 18th of the primary season: Indiana.

For the past several weeks, the corporate media has counted us out of this =
election. The political and financial establishment of this country have =
been vocal in their desire for us to go away. To get in line.

Today, the voters had another idea.

Every victory we earn is extraordinarily important for our political =
revolution. Not just because of the delegates we earn, but because each =
win and all the work that goes into that effort sends an unmistakable =
message to the establishment of this country that we will never stop =
fighting for the values we share. I say we keep fighting. Are you with me?

Your $2.70 contribution to our campaign sends a powerful message that we =
will fight for the values we share all the way through the Democratic =
convention and beyond.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/indiana-poll?refcode=3Dem160502

The next states up are West Virginia, Kentucky and Oregon. They are all =
places we have a chance to do very well. I am in this fight through the =
Democratic convention. Thank you for standing with me.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

The Clinton campaign thinks this campaign is over, sisters and brothers.

They are wrong.

Maybe it's over for the insiders and the party establishment, but the =
voters in Indiana had a different idea. The campaign wasn't over for them. =
It isn't over for the voters in West Virginia. It isn't over for Democrats =

Sisters and Brothers -

In the United States today, the wealthiest country in the history of the =
world, 47 million Americans are living in poverty.

Almost 22 percent of American children are poor and we have the highest =
child poverty rate of almost any major country on earth.

Let's be clear. Living in poverty doesn't just mean you don't have enough =
money to buy a big screen TV, a fancy laptop, or the latest iPhone. It =
goes much deeper than that.

Living in poverty means you are less likely to have a good grocery store =
in your community selling healthy food. Far too often it means you don't =
know where your next meal is going to come from. Living in poverty means =
you are less likely to have access to a doctor, dentist or mental health =
care provider. It means you have less access to public transportation, =
which makes it harder to find a job. It means you are less likely to have =
access to child care.

In the United States of America, poverty is often a death sentence.

Yesterday, I spoke about poverty in McDowell County, West Virginia -- one =
of the poorest counties in one of the poorest states in America. In 2014, =
over 35 percent of the residents in McDowell lived in poverty, including =
nearly half of the children. The roads are crumbling and only 6 percent of =
adults have a college education. Less than two-thirds have graduated high =
school. It has the lowest life expectancy for men in the entire nation. I =
hope you'll watch part of my speech on poverty and share it with friends =
and family on social media.

WATCH THE VIDEO: =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/share/poverty-is-a-death-sentence

Poverty is an issue we must address. In 2011, the American Journal of =
Public Health found that 130,000 people died in just one year alone as a =
result of poverty.

This is not an issue we can just sweep under the rug and hope it will go =
away. Because it won't.

And when I talk about it being too late for establishment politics and =
economics, this is what I mean. When I talk about thinking big and outside =
the box, about rejecting incremental change, I am talking about the =
millions of Americans who live in poverty who have been tossed out, left =
behind, and abandoned by the rich and powerful. We need to create an =
economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.

Here's what we need to do:

1. Rebuild our country's crumbling infrastructure. A $1 trillion =
investment in our infrastructure will create at least 13 million jobs all =
over America - jobs that cannot be outsourced.
2. We must rewrite our disastrous trade politics that enable corporate =
America to shut down plans in places like West Virginia and move them to =
Mexico, China, and other low-wage countries.
3. We can create 1 million jobs for disadvantaged youths through =
legislation I introduced with Rep. John Conyers of Michigan.
4. We need to increase the wages of at least 53 million American workers =
by raising the minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 an hour to $15 =
an hour.
5. At a time when women workers earn 79 cents for every dollar a man =
earns, we need to sign the Paycheck Fairness Act into law. Equal pay for =
equal work.
6. We need to make health care a right for every man, woman, and child =
through a Medicare for All single-payer system.
7. We need to treat drug addiction like a mental health issue, not a =
criminal issue.
8. We need to ensure every worker in this country has at least 12 weeks of =
paid family and medical leave, two weeks of paid vacation, and one week of =
paid sick days.
9. We need to impose a tax on Wall Street to make public colleges and =
universities tuition free while substantially reducing student debt.
10. At a time when half of older workers have no retirement savings, we're =
not going to cut Social Security, we're going to expand it so people can =
retire with dignity and respect.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	Poverty is an issue we must address. In 2011, the American Journal of =
Public Health found that 130,000 people died in just one year alone as a =
result of poverty.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	This is not an issue we can just sweep under the rug and hope it will go =
away. Because it won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	And when I talk about it being too late for establishment politics and =
economics, this is what I mean. When I talk about thinking big and outside =
the box, about rejecting incremental change, I am talking about the =
millions of Americans who live in poverty who have been tossed out, left =
behind, and abandoned by the rich and powerful. We need to create an =
economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	Here&rsquo;s what we need to do:</p>
<ol style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;"><li>
		Rebuild our country&rsquo;s crumbling infrastructure. A $1 trillion =
investment in our infrastructure will create at least 13 million jobs all =
over America - jobs that cannot be outsourced.</li>
	<li>
		We must rewrite our disastrous trade policies that enable corporate =
America to shut down plans in places like West Virginia and move them to =
Mexico, China, and other low-wage countries.</li>
	<li>
		We can create 1 million jobs for disadvantaged youths through =
legislation I introduced with Rep. John Conyers of Michigan.</li>
	<li>
		We need to increase the wages of at least 53 million American workers by =
raising the minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 an hour to $15 an =
hour.</li>
	<li>
		At a time when women workers earn 79 cents for every dollar a man earns, =
we need to sign the Paycheck Fairness Act into law. Equal pay for equal =
work.</li>
	<li>
		We need to make health care a right for every man, woman, and child =
through a Medicare for All single-payer system.</li>
	<li>
		We need to treat drug addiction like a mental health issue, not a =
criminal issue.</li>
	<li>
		We need to ensure every worker in this country has at least 12 weeks of =
paid family and medical leave, two weeks of paid vacation, and one week of =
paid sick days.</li>
	<li>
		We need to impose a tax on Wall Street to make public colleges and =
universities tuition free while substantially reducing student debt.</li>
	<li>
		At a time when half of older workers have no retirement savings, =
we&rsquo;re not going to cut Social Security, we&rsquo;re going to expand =
it so people can retire with dignity and respect.</li>
</ol><p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	No president can do all of these things alone. We need millions of =
Americans to begin to stand up and fight back and demand a government that =
represents all of us. That is the political revolution.</p>

July 9, 2015 - shortly after Jeb Bush announced that his super PAC had =
raised $114 million.

"We still don't know the details of who gave all that money, but we =
believe some of it came in the form of million - and even multimillion =
dollar checks from a small handful of right-wing mega-donors." - Clinton =
campaign manager Robby Mook

May  5, 2016 - shortly after Donald Trump becomes the presumptive =
Republican Party nominee.

"Hillary Clinton's supporters in recent days have been making a furious =
round of calls to top Bush family donors to try to convince them that she =
represents their values better than Donald Trump." - Politico

Bernie Sanders believes that you cannot change a corrupt system by taking =
its money.

We are funding our campaign a different way. And every vote we earn, =
delegate we claim, and state we win from now until the convention is only =
because people have come together to say they are SICK AND TIRED of the =
billionaire class buying our candidates and elections. And that's why we =
ask:

Can Bernie count on you to make a $2.70 contribution today? Your donation, =
along with the thousands being made right now, will ensure we have the =
resources we need to fight for the values we share through the Democratic =
convention.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gop-money?refcode=3Dem160507

Donald Trump's nomination means the Democratic Party has a generational =
opportunity to establish itself as the party that will fight to provide =
health care as a right for every man, woman and child in this country. The =
party that will lead the way to tuition-free college so kids can graduate =
without crushing debt. The party that takes our democracy back from the =
oligarchy that Trump and Jeb Bush represent.=20

That is what the political revolution is about, and why your contribution =
is so important.

All my best,

Now that Ted Cruz and John Kasich have dropped out, it looks almost =
certain that Donald Trump will accept the Republican Party's presidential =
nomination in Cleveland this July.

So there's been a lot of talk over the past few days about how Democrats =
and independents must do everything we can to defeat Trump in November. =
And we must! Because a President Trump would be a catastrophe.

But it's not enough to just be against Donald Trump. We also need to be =
for a bold platform.

Here's the truth: Donald Trump's nomination means the Democratic Party has =
a generational opportunity to establish itself as the party that will =
fight to provide health care as a right for every man, woman and child in =
this country. The party that will lead the way to tuition-free college so =
kids can graduate without crushing debt. The party that takes our =
democracy back from the oligarchy Trump represents.

Every vote we earn, delegate we claim, and state we win between now and =
the convention amplifies that message exponentially. And that's why it's =
important that I ask:

Can Bernie count on you to make a $2.70 contribution today? Your donation, =
along with the thousands being made right now, will ensure we have the =
resources to win West Virginia on Tuesday and fight through the Democratic =
convention.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/never-trump?refcode=3Dem160508

The Democratic Party is the party that passed the Social Security Act, a =
40 hour work week and the minimum wage, Medicare, the Civil Rights Act and =
much more. Surely we can aspire to more than simply convincing enough =
Americans that a reality television star should never be our president.

This moment in our history calls for transformational change. And with =
Donald Trump as the Republican Party's nominee, it is within our grasp. =
But only if we're willing to reach just a bit further than the =
establishment says is possible.

West Virginia votes tomorrow, and this primary matters, sisters and =
brothers. A lot.

If we are able to win in West Virginia tomorrow, not only would we cut =
further into Secretary Clinton's lead, but it will send a powerful message =
to the Democratic Party establishment about an issue at the heart of our =
campaign in that state: poverty.

When Bernie talks about transformational change in this country, he is =
talking about the millions of Americans who live in poverty, who have been =
tossed out, left behind, and abandoned by the rich and the powerful. =
People like those in McDowell County, West Virginia, where he visited last =
week.

So let's go out and win this primary tomorrow, because doing so will send =
an unmistakable message that our political revolution demands more than =
incremental change. We want an economy that works for all of us, not just =
the 1 percent. But we need your help to get there:

Your $2.70 contribution before West Virginia votes will help us win an =
important state and send a powerful message that you demand a campaign for =
transformational change from the Democratic Party's nominee.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/west-virginia

Eight years ago, Hillary Clinton won West Virginia with 67 percent of the =
vote. She beat Barack Obama by 41 points. But we are doing very well, =
precisely because Bernie is willing to tell the truth about the issues =
facing working families across the this country, and what is required to =
change course.

If we continue to stand together and fight, I believe that we will win =
tomorrow.

In solidarity,

<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	If we are able to win in West Virginia <a href=3D"#" =

would we cut further into Secretary Clinton&rsquo;s lead, but it will send =
a powerful message to the Democratic Party establishment about an issue at =
the heart of our campaign in that state: poverty.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	When Bernie talks about transformational change in this country, he is =
talking about the millions of Americans who live in poverty, who have been =
tossed out, left behind, and abandoned by the rich and the powerful. =
People like those in McDowell County, West Virginia, where he visited <a =
href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">last =
week</a>.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	So let&rsquo;s go out and win this primary <a href=3D"#" =
style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">tomorrow</a>, because =
doing so will send an unmistakable message that our political revolution =
demands more than incremental change. We want an economy that works for =
all of us, not just the 1 percent. But we need your help to get there:</p>

<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	Eight years ago, Hillary Clinton won West Virginia with 67 percent of the =

change course.</p>

Sisters and Brothers -

The corporate media have always treated this race as if it was over. The =
political establishment hopes we'll all just fall in line. But if you're =
looking for a sign that the Clinton campaign knows this primary is far =
from finished, here it is:

"Clinton back on the air with TV ads" - Politico, May 9, 2016

The article concludes with this line, "Clinton's campaign is eager to stop =
Sanders from gaining momentum with a string of victories through May." But =
here's the truth: there is no stopping a set of ideas whose time has come, =
no matter how many ads they run.

West Virginia votes today. Oregon and Kentucky hold their primaries in one =
week. It's been a pretty crazy election, and I know that if we continue to =
stand together, anything is possible.

Add a $2.70 contribution to our campaign today and we are going to do very =
well in West Virginia, Oregon, and Kentucky. From there it's on to =
California, New Jersey and the rest of the June 7th states, where there is =
so much at stake.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/every-last-vote

Last week's victory in Indiana was a tremendous surprise to the corporate =
media and political establishment. Hopefully we'll enjoy the same result =
later tonight in West Virginia and in Oregon and Kentucky next week. =
Bernie's working hard, the staff and volunteers are doing the same. The =
rest is up to all of us.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

Sisters and Brothers -

We just got word that we won our 19th state, taking the majority of the =
delegates in today's primary in West Virginia.

Every vote we earn and every delegate we secure sends an unmistakable =
message about the values we share, the country's support for the ideas of =
our campaign, and a rejection of Donald Trump and his values.

Now we're on to two more primaries next week in Kentucky and Oregon, where =
we also hope to do very well. So let's keep going.

Add a $2.70 contribution to our campaign and we can win Kentucky and =
Oregon next week and send a powerful message that we'll fight for our =
values all the way up to the Democratic convention:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/west-virginia-win?refcode=3Dem1=
60510

There is nothing I would like more than to take on and defeat Donald =
Trump, someone who must never become president of this country. But I =
believe that it is not enough to just reject Trump - this is an =
opportunity to define a progressive vision for America. Voters agree: just =
today, three new polls showed that we are the best campaign to defeat =
Trump.

We fully acknowledge we have an uphill climb ahead of us, but we're used =
to that. We have been fighting uphill from the day this campaign began, =
and we're going to stay in the race until the last vote is cast. And with =
your help, I hope to take on Trump, too. Thank you for standing with me.

Add a $2.70 contribution to our campaign now:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/west-virginia-win?refcode=3Dem1=

In solidarity,

This is pretty scary, sisters and brothers. A trio of polls released =
yesterday showed Hillary Clinton in a very difficult spot against Donald =
Trump. She led by one in Florida and Pennsylvania, and actually trailed =
him by 4 percent in Ohio.

For months, Bernie Sanders has out-polled Hillary Clinton against Donald =
Trump, and often by extraordinarily large margins. Because we must do =
everything we can to defeat Trump in November, our mission is to win as =
many pledged delegates as we can between now and June 14.

Then we're going to have a contested convention where the Democratic Party =
must decide if they want the candidate with the momentum who is best =
positioned to beat Trump, or if they are willing to roll the dice and =
court disaster simply to protect the status quo for the political and =
financial establishment of this country.

But for our plan to work, we need to keep winning. And that's why we ask:

Can Bernie count on you to make a $3 contribution to help us continue our =
run of wins in Oregon and Kentucky next Tuesday? They're important states =
and Bernie is campaigning hard, but the outcome is up to all of us:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-must-defeat-trump

Some people say we do better against Trump because we haven't faced the =
Republican attack machine yet. But we've been told our goals for the =
future are utopian, and that our plans would raise taxes on middle class =
families. We just never thought those attacks would come in a Democratic =
primary. Yet somehow we keep winning.

We are the best chance to defeat Trump because people united can never be =
defeated. That is why we must keep fighting.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

	This is pretty scary, sisters and brothers. A trio of polls released <a =
href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">yesterday</a> =
showed Hillary Clinton in a very difficult spot against Donald Trump. She =
led by one in Florida and Pennsylvania, and actually trailed him by 4 =
percent in Ohio.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	For months, Bernie Sanders has out-polled Hillary Clinton against Donald =
Trump, and often by extraordinarily large margins. <strong>Because we must =
do everything we can to defeat Trump <a href=3D"#" =
style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">in November,</a> our =
mission is to win as many pledged delegates as we can between now and <a =
href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: #364350;">June =
14</a>.</strong></p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	Then we&rsquo;re going to have a contested convention where the =
Democratic Party must decide if they want the candidate with the momentum =
who is best positioned to beat Trump, or if they are willing to roll the =
dice and court disaster simply to protect the status quo for the political =
and financial establishment of this country.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	<strong>But for our plan to work, we need to keep winning. And =
that&rsquo;s why we ask:</strong></p>

<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	Some people say we do better against Trump because we haven&rsquo;t faced =
the Republican attack machine yet. But we&rsquo;ve been told our goals for =
the future are utopian, and that our plans would raise taxes on middle =
class families. We just never thought those attacks would come in a =
Democratic primary. Yet somehow we keep winning.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">

defeated. That is why we must keep fighting.</p>

Dear Bernie Supporter,

After our big wins in Indiana and West Virginia, Oregon and Kentucky are =
coming up this Tuesday. And if everyone who has signed up to support =
Bernie takes just an hour or two this weekend to call some voters, we =
stand a very good chance of winning both these states and keeping our =
momentum rolling into the June contests.

So we're calling for an all-hands-on-the-phones mobilization this weekend =
to identify Bernie supporters in the upcoming states, and get them out to =
vote. Can you help out?

YES, I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS FOR BERNIE THIS WEEKEND:
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/call-out-the-vote?source=3Dem160512

If you've never made phone calls to voters before, don't worry. It's =
pretty easy. All you need is a computer or a tablet, and a phone. There's =
a simple script for you to follow, and there are volunteers standing by on =
livechat to help if you get stuck.=20
We're going to keep fighting hard until the very end of this primary =
contest, because we know Bernie is by far the better candidate to defeat =
Trump in November. Every vote we win and delegate we claim sends an =
unmistakable message to the political establishment about the strength of =
our progressive agenda.

When we stand together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish. So we hope =
you'll continue fighting with us and keep this political revolution =
rolling strong - all the way to the convention in Philadelphia.

Sign up to call some voters this weekend: =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/call-out-the-vote?source=3Dem160512

In solidarity,

Team Bernie

P.S. If you'd like to hear more about the importance of Kentucky, Oregon =
and our voter contact goals for the rest of the campaign, please join us =
on a special livestream event tomorrow (Friday) at 6 pm ET/3 pm PT: =
http://bernie.to/volstream=20

Sisters and Brothers -

My father Eli immigrated to America from Poland in 1921 after World War I =
at the age of 17. He was not a refugee fleeing war, although much of his =
family later became victims of the Holocaust. He came to America looking =
to make a better life. He never made a lot of money, but it didn't matter =
because he was able to start a family and send his two sons to college. =
That meant the world to him and he loved this country.

While my father came here as an immigrant seeking economic opportunity, =
many immigrants arrived in our country fleeing war, oppression and =
violence. This is true today for thousands of women and unaccompanied =
children, who came to our country in the last several years fleeing =
horrific violence in Latin America.

This week the media reported something that I find not just wrong, but =
inhumane: President Obama is currently planning "a month-long series of =
raids in May and June to deport hundreds of Central American mothers and =
children" who came to our country fleeing that same violence.

Sending women and children back into harm's way after they already fled =
horrendous violence in Central America is painful and inhumane, and must =
be stopped.

Sign my petition asking President Obama to stop these raids and to make =
sure that families fleeing violence in Central America are protected from =
deportation.

SIGN MY PETITION =C2=BB =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/immigration-raids-petition

Donald Trump has of course called for building a "Great Wall" along the =
border with Mexico. Hillary Clinton previously said that these same =
children who fled violence in Latin America "should be sent back" in order =
to "send a clear message."

I happen to see things differently. I don't believe that the United States =
should turn away from our historic role as a haven for the oppressed.

I recently met a young Salvadoran woman who came to the United States on =
her own at the age of 15 to flee gangs trying to recruit her. I've also =
spoken with many children who have told me with tears streaming down their =
faces that they live in daily fear that their parents will be taken away.

The United States of America must continue to be a refuge for the poor, =
the tired, the oppressed, and certainly for women and children fleeing =
horrific violence.

I urge President Obama to use his executive authority to protect families =
by extending Temporary Protective Status for those who fled from Central =
America, and I ask you to join me.

Add your name to mine to ask President Obama to stop planned raids and =
deportations of families fleeing violence in Central and Latin America. =
Together, we can speak up to protect these families.

Dear Sisters and Brothers -

Our victories in Indiana and West Virginia showed the entire nation that =
our political revolution is still going strong. Kentucky and Oregon are =
voting tomorrow, and there are a lot of delegates at stake.

Our in-state staff and volunteers have been working very hard for the past =
few weeks, but they need your help in these last two days to get out the =
vote. There are thousands of voters in both of these states we just can't =
reach with a door knock. A call from a friendly Bernie volunteer may be =
all that's needed to get them out to vote. Will you help us make some of =
those calls?

YES, I CAN CALL VOTERS FOR BERNIE NOW: =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/phonebank

YES, SIGN ME UP TO MAKE CALLS LATER: =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/call-out-the-vote

If you've never made these GOTV calls before, don't worry - they're pretty =
simple. Our Bernie Dialer does all the hard work of dialing numbers for =
you, and will efficiently connect you to targeted voters. You just need to =
follow the script we provide, figure out if someone is a Bernie supporter, =
and if so, help them make a plan to get their vote in for Bernie on =
Tuesday.

Our campaign's unique strength is the amazing power of collective action =
by millions of grassroots volunteers just like you. When we focus this =
voter contact machine on just a couple of states, the results can be =
pretty amazing.

You'll probably be watching election returns tomorrow night - and your =
efforts in the next 36 hours or so will directly influence the results =
that the world sees. Imagine the boost in momentum that a pair of wins =
tomorrow could deliver for our political revolution. Please help make that =
happen by making some calls now, or by signing up for a call shift later =
today or tomorrow.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

Sisters and Brothers -- We had some amazing election results last night. =
We won the Oregon primary and came to yet another virtual tie, this time =
in Kentucky. That&#39;s 21 victories for us so far, plus three more =
virtual ties where the margin was less than one percent of the vote.

Now some people say that we have a steep hill to climb, and that is =
absolutely true. But together we have been climbing that steep hill from =
day one of our campaign. And let me be clear as I can be: we are in until =
the last ballot is cast.

This is the beginning of the final push to win California. But we are =
going to fight for every last vote, because every delegate we win is a =
statement of public support for the values we share.

Make a $2.70 contribution to our campaign today to help us win California =
and ensure we have the resources to continue our fight all the way to the =
Democratic Convention.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-won-oregon

I come from the working class of this country, and I will be damned if we =
allow the Republican Party, who represent the rich and powerful, to win =
the votes of working class Americans.

It is my belief that the candidate best prepared to stop Donald Trump from =
winning the White House is the candidate who supports a $15 federal =
minimum wage, who stands on picket lines with striking workers, and who =
will fight to take our democracy back from the billionaire class.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Dear Bernie Supporter,

After a convincing victory in Oregon and virtual tie in Kentucky on =
Tuesday, our campaign now pivots to California - where a whopping 475 =
pledged delegates will be at stake in the June 7th election.

We have a great opportunity in California, but we have to act fast. =
Hundreds of thousands of Californians want to vote for our progressive =
agenda and a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump handily. But to vote =
for Bernie, these Californians must be registered as a Democrat (or "no =
party preference," and request a Democratic ballot) no later than this =
Monday, May 23rd.

That's where we come in! Fortunately, California offers online voter =
registration, so we're calling targeted voters in California this weekend =
to remind them of the opportunity to re-register and vote for Bernie. If =
everyone who supports Bernie puts in just an hour or two to call =
Californians, we'll have a yuuuge impact. Will you help out?

YES, I'LL HELP BERNIE WIN CALIFORNIA BY CALLING TO REGISTER VOTERS:
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/get-california-registered?source=3Dem1=
60519t

If you've never called voters for Bernie before, don't worry. It's pretty =
easy. You just need a computer or a tablet, and a phone. We provide a =
simple script for you to follow, and there are helpful volunteers standing =
by on livechat to assist if you need.=20
We're staying in this fight because each and every vote cast for our =
campaign sends a strong message to the political establishment that we =
will not continue to accept the status quo of a corrupt political system =
that holds in place a rigged economy. Every state we win and vote we earn =
strengthens our hand in delivering that message at the convention in =
Philadelphia.

So we hope you'll continue fighting with us and keep this political =
revolution rolling strong.

Sign up to call some California voters this weekend: https://go.berniesand=
ers.com/page/s/get-california-registered?source=3Dem160519t

In solidarity,

Team Bernie

P.S. If you'd like to hear directly from our organizing staff about this =
California project and our goals for the rest of the campaign, please join =
us on a special livestream event tonight (Thursday) at 8 pm ET/5 pm PT.  =
Just click here: http://bernie.to/volstream

When we started this campaign, my greatest fear was that if we did not do =
well that it would be a setback not just for me, but for the ideas driving =
our campaign.

We had no campaign organization, no money, and very little name =
recognition. The corporate media called us "fringe," we were taking on the =
entire Democratic establishment, and we were down 60 points or more in the =
national polls.

Then a supporter from Chicago, Illinois made the first contribution to our =
campaign -- for $3. A few minutes later, $50 from a supporter in =
California, then $10 from someone in Georgia. A little more than 12 months =
later, I am humbled to share that our campaign has received more than 7.6 =
million contributions through April, more than any presidential candidate =
at this point in a campaign ever. And we're just getting started.

Your support has powered us to 21 victories and a much larger lead against =
Donald Trump than Secretary Clinton's campaign. So we've created a website =
to show everyone the depth and diversity of our political revolution. It's =
very important that you visit and share it with everyone you know today: =

Bernie Supporter:

A massive haul of 475 pledged delegates will be up for grabs in =
California's June 7th election. We hope to win a big majority of those.

Since this is a people-powered campaign, we're asking for your help - in =
any of the following four ways - to do that!

1. Call some California voters now. We're working to get as many =
Californians as possible registered to vote for Bernie before the voter =
registration deadline this Monday. Lots of voters - even those in other =
parties - are looking for the strongest candidate to beat Trump, and polls =
consistently show that that's Bernie.

MAKE CALLS TO CALIFORNIA NOW:=20

https://go.berniesanders.com/call-ca-now-2

2. Sign up to call California voters later. Since California offers online =
voter registration, we'll be making calls right up through the deadline =
Monday evening. And every voter we can register, or re-register as a =
Democrat (or "no party preference"), is another potential vote for Bernie.

SIGN UP TO MAKE SOME CALLS LATER:=20

https://go.berniesanders.com/call-ca-later-2

3. Share our California voter registration page on Facebook. If you have =
friends in California, tag them and ask them to spread the word too. Voter =
registration numbers are already trending up this year in the Golden =
State, so let's keep that momentum going!

SHARE ON FACEBOOK AND TAG SOME FRIENDS:=20

https://go.berniesanders.com/share-ca-2

4. Contribute to support our campaign. We don't take money from super =
PACs, and have shocked the political establishment by showing that =
Americans just like you are eager and ready to fund a grassroots campaign =
that's not beholden to wealthy donors. Your donation will help keep our =
political revolution rolling all the way into the Democratic convention in =
July.

CONTRIBUTE TO SUPPORT OUR CAMPAIGN:=20

https://go.berniesanders.com/donate-160521-2

We're staying in this fight all the way to the convention, because we know =
that Bernie is the strongest candidate to beat Trump in the fall. Every =
state we win and every vote we earn strengthens our hand in delivering =
that message at the convention in Philadelphia, and signals to the =
political establishment that we will not accept the status quo of a =
corrupt political system that holds in place a rigged economy.

In solidarity,

Team Bernie

Sisters and Brothers -

The political revolution is not just about electing a president. We need a =
Congress with members who believe, like Bernie, that we cannot change a =
corrupt system by taking its money.

So let me introduce you to Tim Canova, a progressive challenger who is =
running against Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz in a Democratic primary in =
Florida this year.

Tim endorsed Bernie's presidential campaign, and was inspired to run =
because of Wasserman Schultz' support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. =
His campaign is funded like ours, by lots of people giving small amounts =
of money.

And on issues like taking on Wall Street, making tuition free at public =
colleges, and reforming our broken campaign finance system, he is someone =
you can be proud to support. That's why Bernie is endorsing Tim's =
campaign, and why we're proud to ask:

Splitting a $3 contribution between Bernie 2016 and Tim Canova for =
Congress will help elect progressives up and down the ballot while sending =
an UNMISTAKABLE message about our political revolution's commitment to =
electing candidates who share our values:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/canova-for-congress

A few weeks ago, we raised a tremendous amount of money for three =
progressive candidates for Congress. Your support changed their races =
overnight. In the days ahead, we're going to add a dozen or more =
additional candidates to that list.

We're doing this because it is too late for establishment politics and =
establishment economics. We need real change. We need U.S. Senators, =
members of Congress and state legislators who have the guts to take on the =
big money interests whose greed is destroying the American middle class.

Tim Canova is one of those candidates, and I hope you'll join Bernie in =
support of his campaign:

Split a $3 contribution between Bernie 2016 and Tim Canova for Congress =
today. This is important:

Thank you for powering this political revolution.

Sisters and Brothers -

No president, not Bernie Sanders, not the greatest president you could =
possibly imagine, can take on the billionaire class alone. And that's =
because change never happens from the top down, it always occurs from the =
bottom up.

That's why today I am announcing my support for eight progressive state =
legislative candidates who embody the spirit of our political revolution.

Today, they are state representatives running for re-election or =
challenging to win their first race. Tomorrow, they'll be progressives =
running for Congress and maybe even the presidency. And in 2020, they'll =
help determine how congressional districts are drawn for the remainder of =
the next decade -- a key to Democrats taking back and holding the House of =
Representatives for the decade to come.

It's up to us to transform the future of the Democratic Party, and that's =
why I am proud to ask:

Can I count on you to split a $2.70 contribution to our campaign and a =
great slate of progressive state legislative candidates as a way of saying =
we are going to fight to transform our country, and the Democratic Party, =
from the bottom up?

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/bernie-for-state-candidates

We are going to keep fighting for every vote, every delegate, and every =
state, but this moment also requires helping progressives who are fighting =
for change at the local level. That is the political revolution, and =
that's why splitting your contribution between our campaign and this great =
slate of local candidates is so important.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

	<strong>Justin Bamberg</strong> is a state representative from South =
Carolina who was an early endorser of Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s campaign but =
switched his endorsement before the primary because of Bernie&rsquo;s work =
for "racial, social, and economic justice." Justin won his last election =
by ONLY 113 votes and needs our support in what&rsquo;s sure to be another =
close race this <a href=3D"#" style=3D"text-decoration:none; color: =

	<strong>David Bowen</strong> is the son of Jamaican immigrants who is =
running for his second term in the Wisconsin State Legislature. He fought =
for and won a living wage for Milwaukee city employees and is a =
progressive champion Wisconsin needs.</p>

	<strong>Carol Ammons</strong> became the first African-American woman to =
win election in her district of the Illinois State Legislature, scoring an =
upset election victory against a well-funded establishment opponent. She's =
fighting for progressive issues and candidates and deserves our =
support.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	<strong>Chris Pearson</strong> is running for the Vermont State Senate =
after spending four terms in the Vermont House of Representatives. He is a =
champion on the issues of livable wages, strong labor union advocacy, =
climate change, and voting rights. This year he was able to pass a bill =

Sisters and Brothers -

When I introduced a bill in the Senate that would slow the effects of =
climate change, I knew that I could count on Bernie Sanders to stand with =
me from the very first day.

Last year Bernie and I introduced the Keep It in the Ground Act, which =
would prevent new fracking, coal mining, and oil drilling on federal =
lands, as well as all new offshore oil drilling.

Bernie and I are committed to this fight because we know we can - and must =
- slow the pace of climate change. Scientists tell us that we need to keep =
80 percent of remaining fossil fuels in the ground to prevent the worst =
effects of climate change.

I knew I could count on Bernie to fight this fight -- can I count on you, =
too? Add your name to join me and Bernie in supporting the Keep It in the =
Ground Act. Click here to say you support our plan to prevent the worst of =
climate change's effects:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/keep-it-in-the-ground

To stop climate change from destroying our planet, we must act quickly and =
boldly to bring an end to the extraction and exploitation of fossil fuels =
in lands owned by the American people.

Not one more lease to extract coal.

Not one more license for fracking.

Not a single additional offshore oil drilling rig.

We must keep 80 percent of the world's proven reserves in the ground - and =
the Keep It in the Ground Act is a powerful step toward this goal to avert =
climate catastrophe.

The fossil fuel industry is geared up for a fight. The Koch Brothers want =
us to fail, and we expect heavy resistance from people who profit off of =
the destruction of our planet.

Showing tremendous public support will help pass the Keep It in the Ground =
Act - will you be a partner with me and Bernie in this movement to fight =
climate change?

Click here to show your support for my bill with Bernie Sanders to keep =
fossil fuels in the ground:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/keep-it-in-the-ground

We're building a movement to take on climate change and speed up our =
transition to clean, renewable energy. We need to act together and we need =
to act now.

Sisters and Brothers -

When we talk about a "political revolution," we are not just talking about =
tinkering around the edges of American society.

We are talking about electing candidates up and down the ballot who =
recognize that it is too late for establishment politics and economics in =
this country. Candidates who are on the side of working people and not =
big-money interests; the elderly, the sick and the poor, and not Wall =
Street speculators or insurance companies.

That is what our campaign for president is about, and it is why I am happy =
to support my friend Russ Feingold's campaign for U.S. Senate.

Russ led the fight with me to make the Affordable Care Act stronger in =
2009. He voted against the USA Patriot Act and the war in Iraq. He =
authored and passed landmark campaign finance reform legislation and his =
campaign is powered by small-dollar contributions like ours. Now he's =
running for U.S. Senate, and with time running out before our final FEC =
fundraising deadline of the primary, I have to ask:

Splitting a $2.70 contribution to Bernie 2016 and Russ Feingold's campaign =
before our final FEC fundraising deadline of the Democratic primary will =
help us win California and elect a great progressive to the U.S. Senate.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/feingold-for-senate

The final six states in the Democratic primary vote in less than two weeks =
and each contribution we receive, delegate we earn and state we carry =
sends an unmistakable message of support for the values we share. We are =
working hard to win every single day, but we must also fight for change at =
the local level. Your contribution helps us accomplish both of those =
goals.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers,

California, here we come. A shocking new poll just came out that shows us =
just TWO POINTS back from Secretary Clinton in California's June 7 =
primary.

California Poll (May 13-22)
Public Policy Institute of California

Hillary Clinton: 46%
Bernie Sanders: 44%

The first poll of this primary in California had us losing the state by 53 =
percent. Now we're within striking distance of winning the most delegates =
in a single state of this entire election.

Winning California would send an unmistakable message to the political =
establishment and the Democratic convention, and that's why we have to ask =
for your help in two ways:

1) Call California voters this weekend:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/call-california-for-bernie

2) Contribute $3 to Bernie 2016:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/win-california

Make no mistake: every vote we earn, delegate we secure, and state we win =
is an affirmation of the progressive values shared by our political =
revolution. That's why we're going to have thousands of volunteers =
knocking on doors and making calls this weekend, and why we're going to =
work hard towards the final FEC deadline of our primary next week.

Bernie wants to see California in our win column. I do too.

Do you?

Yes, I can volunteer to call California voters for Bernie this weekend:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/call-california-for-bernie

Yes, I can contribute $3 set to Bernie's campaign to help win California:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/win-california

Five more states also vote with California, and we're going to fight to =
win there too. Let's keep our political revolution going all the way to =
the convention.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

Dear Bernie Supporter,

Thanks in no small part to your efforts on the phones last weekend, voter =
registration numbers in California saw a big surge right before the May =
23rd deadline.

We also learned this week that - according to a poll from the Public =
Policy Institute of California - we're now within striking distance of a =
victory in California on June 7th.

Our in-state staff and volunteers are working incredibly hard for the win, =
but they need your help. This is the most critical weekend for us to get =
on the phones and identify Bernie supporters, so that next week our ground =
teams know which doors to knock and which voters to persuade. Can you =
pitch in an hour or two of your time this weekend to help Bernie win =
California?

YES, I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS THIS WEEKEND: https://go.berniesanders.com/page/=
s/call-california-for-bernie?source=3Dem160528text

If you've never called voters for Bernie before, don't worry - it's not =
hard. You just need a computer or a tablet, and a phone. We provide a =
simple script for you to follow, and dedicated volunteers are standing by =
on livechat to assist if you run into any problems.

Thanks to your support, we've won 21 primaries and caucuses so far this =
year - a result that no one would have predicted when we launched this =
campaign just over a year ago. California represents the biggest prize of =
all, with 475 pledged delegates at stake, and a victory there would send a =
gigantic signal to the political establishment that our movement has real =
staying power.

With your help, we'll keep this political revolution going all the way to =
the convention in Philadelphia. So we hope you can help out this weekend =
and sign up to call for an hour or two.

In solidarity,

Team Bernie



I CAN'T VOLUNTEER, BUT I'LL CONTRIBUTE: https://secure.actblue.com/contrib=

Sisters and Brothers -

Today is one of the most important days of our campaign: the final FEC =
fundraising deadline of the Democratic primary.

The last six states vote in one week, including California -- the contest =
with the most delegates at stake in this race. And what today's deadline =
will tell us is whether or not working people coming together and =
contributing small amounts of money can compete and win to the end against =
the millionaires and billionaires who have bankrolled Hillary Clinton's =
campaign and her largest super PACs.

Our mission now is to go into the Democratic convention with as many =
votes, delegates and states as possible. From there, superdelegates will =
have to consider who is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump. That's =
why I have to ask:

If every supporter who has signed up to join our campaign made one $2.70 =
contribution before tonight's midnight deadline, it would ensure we have =
the resources we need to win in California and make our strongest case =
possible at the Democratic convention.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-final-deadline

Let me be very honest. Our path to victory is very narrow. It would take =
us defying every single expectation next Tuesday and making a very =
convincing case at the convention. But we have been fighting uphill from =
day one, and I believe we owe it to ourselves to try. That's why your =
contribution before tonight's deadline, the last of the primary, is so =
important.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

This was amazing the first time we showed it to you in October, sisters =
and brothers, and it's just as amazing today.

What you're seeing is a real feed from earlier today of people responding =
to Bernie's email from this morning, adding their contributions before the =
final FEC fundraising deadline of the primary.

Can you add a $2.70 contribution now and be a part of this moment?



Tens of thousands of people have already contributed today before the =
midnight FEC fundraising deadline, adding $2.70, $27, or whatever they can =
afford. I hope you can join them as we prepare for the last week of voting =
in our primary.

In solidarity,

Sisters and Brothers -

In just a few hours, we're going to close the books on the final FEC =
fundraising deadline of the Democratic primary.

Here's the truth: we are still short of hitting the goals that will allow =
us to run the kind of campaign it takes to win in California. And what =
we'd really like is for that money to come from as many people as =
possible. That's been the spirit of this campaign from the start.

Adding your $2.70 contribution right now will help put us over the top. =
You can do that here:

https://go.berniesanders.com/final-deadline

We have received over 8 million individual contributions since this =
campaign started a little over one year ago. That's a record at this point =
in any presidential race in history, and it's something Hillary Clinton's =
campaign can't come close to matching.

Adding one before midnight will ensure we have the resources to win in =
California next week.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

Sisters and Brothers,

When you wake up on June 8, the morning after California and five other =
states vote, will you be able to say that you did everything you could to =
help Bernie win?

Because right now in California, it's very, very, very close.

California Primary Poll (NBC News)
Hillary Clinton: 49%
Bernie Sanders: 47%

This is important: the same poll says that with a higher turnout, we are =
actually winning. And if we win California, it will send the STRONGEST =
message possible to the Democratic establishment heading into the =
convention in July. That's why we have to ask you to help in two ways:

Yes, I can volunteer to call voters in California and other upcoming =
states this weekend:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/win-more-states-for-bernie

Yes, I can contribute $3 to Bernie 2016 to help win California and other =
states on Tuesday:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lets-win-california

How else do we know it's going to be a nail biter in California? Secretary =
Clinton knows it's close too - she's canceling events in New Jersey and is =
racing to California to campaign. (She kept her big-dollar fundraisers on =
the schedule though.)

We have elections happening in New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, South =
Dakota, and Montana on Tuesday night, in addition to California. We think =
we can do very well across the board, and we need you to do everything in =
your power to help us win.

Why? Because every vote, every delegate, and every state that we win gives =
us power at the Democratic convention, and victory is the strongest =
message we can send to the political establishment.

Are you in to help Bernie win?

Yes, I can volunteer to call voters in California and other upcoming =
states this weekend:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/win-more-states-for-bernie

Yes, I can contribute $3 to Bernie 2016 to help win California and other =
states on Tuesday:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lets-win-california

Let's win on Tuesday.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

Bernie Supporter -

A whopping total of 694 pledged delegates are up for grabs on Tuesday, and =
-- especially given the latest polling out of California -- we believe we =
have a good chance of winning a big majority of them. But we need your =
help to do that.

Thousands of in-state volunteers are hitting the streets in these final =
days to find Bernie voters and get them to the polls. But they just can't =
knock the door of every voter we need to contact.

So our task this weekend is pretty simple: call every single Bernie =
supporter we can in the upcoming states, and make sure they have a plan to =
vote on Tuesday. Can Bernie count on you to volunteer a couple hours of =
your time?

YES, I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS THIS WEEKEND:
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/win-more-states-for-bernie?source=3Dem=
160603

If you've never called voters for Bernie before, now is the time to take =
the plunge. Calling on our Bernie Dialer is easy; you just need a computer =
or a tablet, and a phone. We provide a simple script for you to follow, =
connect you directly to the targeted voters, and we have dedicated =
volunteers standing by on livechat to help out if you run into any =
problems.

 Our plan is to go into the Democratic convention in Philadelphia with as =
many votes, delegates and states as possible. From there, the =
superdelegates will have to consider who is the best candidate to take on =
Donald Trump - and the polls consistently show Bernie is that candidate.

So don't let this opportunity slip by. Our collective efforts this weekend =
have the potential to shock the political establishment and show the =
billionaire class that we've had enough of super-PAC-funded politics as =
usual. Your involvement will help write a pivotal chapter in American =
political history, so we're asking you to step up and commit as much =
volunteer time as you can.

In solidarity,

Team Bernie

P.S. If you'd like to learn more about our weekend of action and the =
importance of these June 7th contests, please join us on a special =
livestream event tonight (Friday) at 9 pm ET/6 pm PT: =

Sisters and Brothers -

It's no secret that when we started this campaign, we had no money, very =
little name recognition, and we were taking on the entire Democratic =
establishment in this country.

So when a Democratic National Committee vice chair, Congresswoman Tulsi =
Gabbard, was disinvited from our first debate after calling for more of =
them, people took notice. And when Tulsi quit her post at the DNC to =
endorse our campaign, it sent shockwaves through the political =
establishment.

For the last several months, Tulsi has been a tireless surrogate for our =
campaign. She has joined me at rallies, appeared in ads, and now we're =
campaigning across California where almost every recent poll shows us =
within just a few points of Hillary Clinton.

Today, I want to ask you to join me in accomplishing two goals: help us =
win in California on Tuesday and ensure Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is =
re-elected in November.

Split a $2.70 contribution between our campaign and Tulsi Gabbard's =
re-election, and we will have have the resources we need to win in =
California on Tuesday while supporting a great progressive leader we need =
in Congress:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/tulsi-gabbard

Congresswoman Gabbard is one of the important voices of a new generation =
of leaders. As a veteran of the Iraq War, she understands the cost of war =
and is fighting to create a foreign policy that not only protects America =
but keeps us out of perpetual wars that we should not be in.

Tulsi has been a great friend to our political revolution. And because of =
people like her, and people like you, we have a great chance to win =
California on Tuesday night and close this primary out strong. That's why =
splitting your contribution today is so important.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers,

When we started our campaign, we had the support of hundreds of thousands =
of grassroots supporters beginning to build the movement that we know =
today. And the first member of Congress who saw the potential of our =
political revolution was Congressman Ra=C3=BAl Grijalva.

Ra=C3=BAl was the very first member of Congress to endorse our campaign, =
and he did so proudly. He is a progressive leader in Congress who's not =
afraid to stand up to the political establishment.

And now, as we enter the final primaries of the campaign, I will be =
campaigning in California with my friend Ra=C3=BAl Grijalva by my side =
once more. He is the exact kind of progressive hero we need in Congress, =
and that's why, with the polls so close, I need to ask you to help us win.

Split a $2.70 contribution between our campaign and Ra=C3=BAl Grijalva's =
re-election, and we will have the resources we need to win in California =
on Tuesday while supporting a great progressive leader we need in =
Congress:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/raul-grijalva

When we faced some of the most disingenuous attacks in our primary, it was =
Ra=C3=BAl who was out in front with the media to defend our campaign. It =
was Ra=C3=BAl who helped organized young Latinos in states across the =
country. And it's Ra=C3=BAl's solid progressive vision that we need to =
continue to have in Congress.

Every single poll in California shows it's going to be extremely close. =
That's why Ra=C3=BAl is spending the last days before this primary right =
by my side, earning every vote we can.

We need your help now to win California, and Ra=C3=BAl needs your help to =
win his re-election to Congress in November.

Split a $2.70 contribution between Bernie 2016 and Ra=C3=BAl Grijalva's =
re-election campaign and help us both win:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/raul-grijalva

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Dear Bernie Supporter,

The LA Times came out with some very interesting news on Friday: =
California's voter rolls swelled by more than 650,000 new voters right =
before the registration deadline. This presents us with a golden =
opportunity - we think a big percentage of those new voters are ready to =
support Bernie.

Needless to say, winning California would be a yuuuge boost for our =
movement. We've come from more than 50 points down when we started, to a =
statistical tie in the latest polls. So now, it all depends on turnout.

Our staff and volunteers in California are fired up and working virtually =
around the clock to get all Bernie's supporters to the polls on Tuesday. =
Can you help out on the phones for an hour or two?

YES, I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS BEFORE ELECTION DAY:=20
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/win-more-states-for-bernie?source=3Dem=
160605

If you've never made calls for Bernie before, now is the time to step up. =
It's not a complicated process, and we'll give you all the instructions =
you need to make these important calls. Californians are very receptive to =
Bernie's progressive message, and if we can pull off a victory there =
Tuesday, you'll know you played an important role at this pivotal moment =
of American political history.

 We're fighting hard to win California since it's the final and - with 475 =
pledged delegates up for grabs - biggest state on the primary calendar. A =
strong showing there will give the superdelegates something very important =
to think about as they consider who will be the strongest nominee against =
Trump in the fall.

So we hope you can pitch in a couple hours of your time between now and =
Tuesday to keep our political revolution rolling strong all the way to the =
convention in Philadelphia.

In solidarity,

Team Bernie

Sisters and Brothers -

Tuesday marks the largest set of primaries and caucuses in the Democratic =
nomination process with six states voting for president and 694 pledged =
delegates up for grabs.

Pundits and the political press want to call this race early before every =
last person votes. That threatens to suppress voter turnout in New Jersey, =
California, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and New Mexico. But we're =
not going to let that happen.

On Tuesday, we're going to defy the pundits once more and reach for the =
kind of high voter turnout that will again shock the establishment.

Please make calls to get out the vote for Bernie: =
https://berniesanders.com/phonebank

Throughout this race, we've been sending the establishment a message they =
can't ignore: we won't settle for the status quo. We won't settle for a =
rigged economy held in place by a corrupt system of campaign finance. We =
won't settle for a fossil fuel industry hell-bent on harming our planet to =
pad their profits. We won't settle for a health system that doesn't cover =
everyone.

Let's make our voices heard loud and clear once more in the six states =
voting Tuesday.

In California, a high voter turnout won't just mean a victory for our =
movement. With large numbers of young people hitting the polls, we'll =
boost so many Democrats in major primaries that right-wing Republicans =
will be locked out of general election ballots for some of the most =
important House and Senate races of the fall.

Members of the media and political establishment may have anointed =
Secretary Clinton from day one, but we know that this race is going to =
carry on until the delegates cast ballots at the convention in =
Philadelphia.

We should let the voters decide who they want the Democratic nominee to be =
rather than having the media decide for them. I am asking you to continue =
to stand with Bernie in pushing for the political revolution.

Please make calls to get out the vote for Bernie: =

In solidarity,

message they can&rsquo;t ignore: we won&rsquo;t settle for the status quo. =
We won&rsquo;t settle for a rigged economy held in place by a corrupt =
system of campaign finance. We won&rsquo;t settle for a fossil fuel =
industry hell-bent on harming our planet to pad their profits. We =
won&rsquo;t settle for a health system that doesn&rsquo;t cover =
everyone.</p>

<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	In California, a high voter turnout won&rsquo;t just mean a victory for =
our movement. With large numbers of young people hitting the polls, =
we&rsquo;ll boost so many Democrats in major primaries that right-wing =
Republicans will be locked out of general election ballots for some of the =
most important House and Senate races of the fall.</p>
<p>
	</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	Members of the media and political establishment may have anointed =
Secretary Clinton from day one, but we know that this race is going to =
carry on until the delegates cast ballots at the convention in =
Philadelphia.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	We should let the voters decide who they want the Democratic nominee to =
be rather than having the media decide for them. I am asking you to =
continue to stand with Bernie in pushing for the political revolution.</p>

Sisters and Brothers -

You ask anyone running for office what they hate most about it, and I =
guarantee that virtually every single candidate will say that it's raising =
money.

The way that you have helped me run for president is absolutely =
unprecedented. I get to talk to voters, while my opponent has to talk to =
donors.

The candidates we're endorsing for other races are seeing similar results. =
We funded state legislative candidates' entire campaigns through one =
email. We completely transformed several congressional races because of =
your generosity.

That's why today I'm endorsing 2 new progressives - Eric Kingson in New =
York, and Paul Clements in Michigan - and asking you to again support Lucy =
Flores, Zephyr Teachout, Pramila Jayapal, and Tim Canova in their races =
for Congress.

Split a $2.70 contribution between our campaign and these six progressives =
we need in Congress. Your support can change their races overnight and =
help elect progressives across the country.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/bernie-congress

After 10,000 people contributed to Chris Pearson, who's running for the =
Vermont State Senate, his entire campaign was funded. For the whole =
election! Chris said in response, "What it means for me is now I don't =
have to spend time asking a small number of donors for big checks."

When you helped raise huge sums of money for Zephyr Teachout's campaign in =
New York, she was able to cancel her fundraising calls and head out on the =
picket line with striking workers throughout her district.

Lucy Flores' election is in just one week, and your support for her this =
spring completely upended her primary. Your support for her today could =
put her close to victory.

I'm endorsing Eric Kingson for Congress in New York because he led the =
fight to protect Social Security, and I'm endorsing Paul Clements in =
Michigan because he can help unseat the leading climate change denier in =
Congress. I know that we can transform their races too, like we did for =
Chris, Zephyr, and Lucy.

What we are proving - you and me, sisters and brothers - is that it is =
possible to take back our country from the billionaire class. It is =
possible to stop millionaires and billionaires from buying our democracy. =
And we can do it $27 at a time.

Split a $2.70 contribution between our campaign and those of the =
congressional candidates I support so that together, we can elect a =
progressive Congress not beholden to special interests.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/bernie-congress

Our movement is so powerful that we can change congressional elections =
overnight. Let's keep going.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers,

When we began this campaign a little over a year ago we were considered to =
be a fringe campaign. But over the last year, I think that has changed =
just a little bit.

As of last night, we won 22 state primaries and caucuses with more than 11 =
million votes.

What we understand, and what every one of us has always understood, is =
that real change never occurs from the top on down, always from the bottom =
on up.

That is the history of America. Our fight is to transform our country and =
to understand that we are in this together. That is what OUR movement is =
about.

The struggle continues. We are going to fight for every vote in Tuesday's =
primary in Washington, DC, and then we will bring our political revolution =
to the Democratic convention in Philadelphia.

Say that you will continue to fight for the progressive future our country =
needs by adding a $3 contribution to our campaign today:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/the-struggle-continues

I am pretty good at arithmetic, and I know that the fight in front of us =
is a very, very steep fight, but we will continue to fight for every vote =
and every delegate we can get.

But you know that what we are doing is about more than Bernie Sanders. It =
is all of us together. It is what this movement is about. It is millions =
of people from coast to coast standing up and looking around them and =
knowing that we can do much, much better as a nation.

That whether Wall Street likes it, whether corporate America likes it, =
whether wealthy campaign contributors like it, whether the corporate media =
likes it, we together know what our job is. And that is to bring the =
American people together to create a government that works for us, not the =
1 percent.

Our fight is to transform our country and to understand that we are in =
this together. To understand that all of what we believe is what the =
majority of the American people believe. And to understand that the =
struggle continues.

Adding a $3 contribution now will show that you want to see our fight for =
a progressive future continue all the way to the Democratic convention. =
Make one now:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/the-struggle-continues

Thank you all. The struggle continues.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

In just three days, we will be competing in the Washington, D.C. primary. =
This is the last primary of the Democratic nominating process and we are =
fighting hard for every last vote until the polls close on Tuesday night.

>From there, we will take our issues to the Democratic Convention in =
Philadelphia next month.

But no matter what happens, the truth is that no president, not Bernie =
Sanders, not Hillary Clinton, not the greatest president you can possibly =
imagine can address the enormous problems facing the working families of =
our country by him or herself. That is the truth, and that is why we need =
a grassroots political movement in this country: a political revolution.

And that political revolution must work to elect candidates up and down =
the ballot, including members of Congress who are willing to stand up to =
corporate America and Wall Street. That's why I am endorsing two =
progressives who have done that work throughout their careers: =
Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur and Congressman Rick Nolan.


Split a $2.70 contribution between our campaign and these two great =
progressive members of Congress and we will have the resources to continue =
our political revolution while providing critical support to the kind of =
leaders we need in Congress.


https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/kaptur-nolan

Congressman Rick Nolan (Minnesota) represents one of the most competitive =
congressional districts in the country. Normally when that happens, the =
elected official moves to the "right" to protect their seat. Not Rick. His =
election is a great opportunity to prove one can serve as a progressive =
and still win a difficult race.

Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (Ohio) is a leading voice to adopt fair trade =
policies which not only raise wages in this country, but lift living =
standards throughout the world. She has been fighting for a fair trade =
policy from the day she came to Congress.

I know that if you stand with them, as we have stood together throughout =
this campaign, we are almost certainly going to transform the Democratic =
Party, and we are going to transform this country.


Split a $2.70 contribution between our campaign and these two great =
progressive members of Congress and we will have the resources to continue =
our political revolution while providing critical support to the kind of =

<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	In just three days, we will be competing in the Washington, D.C. primary. =
This is the last primary of the Democratic nominating process and we are =
fighting hard for every last vote until the polls close on Tuesday =
night.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	From there, we will take our issues to the Democratic Convention in =
Philadelphia next month.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	<strong>But no matter what happens, the truth is that no president, not =
Bernie Sanders, not Hillary Clinton, not the greatest president you can =
possibly imagine can address the enormous problems facing the working =
families of our country by him or herself. </strong>That is the truth, and =
that is why we need a grassroots political movement in this country: a =
political revolution.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	And that political revolution must work to elect candidates up and down =
the ballot, including members of Congress who are willing to stand up to =
corporate America and Wall Street. <strong>That&rsquo;s why I am endorsing =
two progressives who have done that work throughout their careers: =
Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur and Congressman Rick Nolan.</strong></p>

<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	<strong>Congressman Rick Nolan (Minnesota) </strong>represents one of the =
most competitive congressional districts in the country. Normally when =
that happens, the elected official moves to the &ldquo;right&rdquo; to =
protect their seat. Not Rick. His election is a great opportunity to prove =
one can serve as a progressive and still win a difficult race.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	<strong>Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (Ohio) </strong>is a leading voice to =
adopt fair trade policies which not only raise wages in this country, but =
lift living standards throughout the world. She has been fighting for a =
fair trade policy from the day she came to Congress.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">

this campaign, we are almost certainly going to transform the Democratic =

Sisters and Brothers -

Washington, D.C. votes today in the final contest of the Democratic =
primary. Our staff and volunteers are working hard for every vote and =
every delegate in the District of Columbia because each is an important =
declaration of support for the values we share, and the issues that have =
powered our campaign.

When we started this campaign, I told you that I was running not to oppose =
any man or woman, but to propose new and far-reaching policies to deal =
with the crises of our time. And for the past fourteen months, through the =
entire primary process, we've sent the establishment a message they can't =
ignore: we won't settle for the status quo.

After today, the voting is done, but our political revolution continues.

I want to talk to you directly on Thursday night about what's next for our =
campaign in a live, online video address at 8:30 p.m. EDT / 5:30 p.m. PDT. =
I hope that you will join:

Sign up to RSVP to watch my live, online video message on Thursday night =
and we'll send you a text message or email shortly before the event =
begins:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/live

This campaign is about more than Bernie Sanders. It is about all of us =
together. It is about millions of people from coast to coast knowing that =
we can do much better as a nation.

I hope that you will join the conversation on Thursday night and ask your =
friends to do the same.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters, Brothers, and Friends,

We are at a critical moment for the future of the Democratic Party and our =
country. Last night marked the last primary as part of the Democratic =
nomination process, and we know that our campaign will enter the =
convention in Philadelphia with more than 1800 delegates.

Our movement has fought against steep odds when so many people counted us =
out. Together we built a political revolution that fought in every one of =
more than 50 primaries and caucuses since February. Our delegates from =
this movement will be the people who vote on the platform of the =
Democratic Party, and who will have influence on not just who the nominee =
is this election, but how the next nominee will be elected, too.

The future of our political revolution depends on you. That's why Bernie =
Sanders will host a live, online video address this Thursday night at 8:30 =
p.m. EDT / 5:30 p.m. PDT. Will you join Bernie?

Sign up to RSVP to watch Bernie Sanders' live, online video message on =
Thursday night and we'll send you a text message or email shortly before =
the event begins.

RSVP TO JOIN =C2=BB =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/live?source=3Dem160615

Our political revolution is not just about what happens in Philadelphia, =
or even at the election in November, during which we must stop Donald =
Trump from becoming president. In order for the work that we have begun to =
be long-lasting for years to come, we must continue our political =
revolution. And we need you to be a part of it.

We'll see you Thursday night.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

Sisters, Brothers, and Friends,

A big reason for our tremendous success throughout our campaign has been =
because we have clearly articulated a vision for the future of America =
that encompasses social justice, economic justice, racial justice, and =
environmental justice.

This vision is not only what I want -- it's what the 12 million Americans =
who voted for a political revolution want. You want real change in this =
country, you want it now and are prepared to take on the political =
cowardice and powerful special interests which have prevented that change =
from happening.

It is possible to transform America into a country that unquestionably =
works for working families and not the billionaire class. One place we =
think the agenda of these 12 million Americans should be reflected is in =
the official platform of the Democratic Party.

What issues do you want to be the focus of the Democratic Party platform? =
Tell us the issues you think should be included.

TELL US YOUR DEMOCRATIC PARTY PLATFORM PRIORITIES =C2=BB =
https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/Democratic-party-platform

We aren't afraid to think big, and our agenda shows it. Together, we have =
called for a $15 minimum wage, a Medicare-for-all single payer health care =
system, breaking up the big banks, free tuition at public colleges, a ban =
on fracking, a carbon tax, and so much more.

The platform matters because it is a document that enshrines the values =
and goals of the Democratic Party. It's a document to which we can point =
and say, "This is what we believe, and this is what we fight for."

And so the Democratic Party has a choice in the coming weeks, and that =
choice is whether or not to embrace a bold, fearless, progressive platform =
that has the potential to transform our country for generations.

We need to hear from you about what you think the most important issues =
are that should be included in the platform.

Tell us what you think should be the priorities of the Democratic Party's =
platform:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/Democratic-party-platform

We're taking our campaign, our values, and our movement to the Democratic =
convention in Philadelphia. We're excited to bring your thoughts on the =
party platform too. Thanks for being a part of it.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters, Brothers, and Friends,

Before our nearly 1,900 delegates can vote at the Democratic convention =
next month, we need to actually get them to Philadelphia.

Here's the thing: our delegates are not wealthy campaign contributors. =
They're not party insiders or establishment elites. They're working folks, =
and it's not easy for many of them to fly to Philly and stay in hotels for =
a week.

We really need to have all of our delegates at the Democratic convention =
because we expect there could be critical votes for the party platform and =
electoral process. We'd hate to fall short on these votes because some of =
our delegates couldn't afford to go to the convention.

That's why I'm asking you directly:

Make a $2.70 contribution to our campaign before Thursday's midnight FEC =
deadline to help our delegates come to the Democratic convention so we can =
have our entire political revolution represented next month in =
Philadelphia.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-delegates

You'd be shocked at how expensive it is to attend the Democratic =
convention. It can cost more than $4,000 per delegate!

Hotels are booked months in advance, and then resold at higher prices. =
Lobbyists throw all sorts of fancy parties. It's easy for the political =
establishment to navigate this and know whom to call to find the right way =
in. That, or they're wealthy enough to pay for themselves.

Our political revolution is not made up of people like that. Our folks =
need help to get to the convention and stay there.

You can make sure all our delegates represent Bernie at the Democratic =
convention. Can you help us before Thursday's midnight FEC fundraising =
deadline?

Contribute $2.70 to our campaign and make sure that Bernie's delegates can =
get to the Democratic convention next month.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-delegates

Thank you for stepping up to help the members of our political revolution.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

Sisters, Brothers and Friends -

Our struggle over the Democratic Party platform is about making clear that =
we intend to create an economy that works for all of us, and not just the =
wealthy and powerful.

Now, we've made some great progress to include a number of very important =
initiatives that we have been fighting to achieve during this campaign. =
Major accomplishments that will begin to move this country in the right =
direction like breaking up huge financial institutions and enacting a 21st =
Century Glass-Steagall Act, a historic expansion of Social Security, =
taking on the greed of the pharmaceutical companies, banning private =
prisons, eliminating super PACs, and moving to public financing of =
elections, and more.

But more needs to be done. And the most important issue is to make it =
clear that we must defeat the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership.

So I want you to mark July 8 on your calendar - that is the next meeting =
of the Democratic Platform Committee in Orlando, Florida. Between now and =
then, our job is to do everything we can to rally support for an amendment =
to the platform in strong opposition to the TPP.

And I believe that if we all make our voices heard between now and then, =
we can win this fight:

Add your name to tell the DNC Platform Committee to make sure the party's =
platform includes our amendment to prevent the disastrous TPP trade deal =
from ever coming up for a vote:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/tpp-dnc

Let me be clear: this is not about embarrassing anyone. This is about =
preventing the outsourcing of jobs, protecting the environment, stopping =
pharmaceutical companies from increasing the price of prescription drugs, =
preserving our democracy, and respecting human rights.

This is about you and millions of other people making our voices heard =
that we need to create a Democratic Party which fights for working =
families and not wealthy campaign contributors.

If we succeed, we will be in a very strong position to stop a vote on the =
TPP and to fundamentally rewrite our trade agreements to end the race to =
the bottom and lift up the living standards of people in this country and =
throughout the world.

That is the work of our political revolution, and you are the =
revolutionaries. And I believe that if we continue to stand together and =
fight for the values we share, we will transform the Democratic Party.

But that starts with bringing the entire party together and speaking with =
one voice in opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership:

Add your name to tell the DNC Platform Committee to make sure the party's =
platform includes our amendment to prevent the disastrous TPP trade deal =
from ever coming up for a vote:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/tpp-dnc

It is imperative that this platform be not only the most progressive in =
the history of the Democratic Party, but that it includes a set of =
policies that will be fought for and implemented by Democratic elected =
officials.

I am going to do everything I can to rally support in Orlando for our =
amendment opposing the TPP. But I want to be clear that if we fail there =
we are going to take this fight to the floor of the Democratic Party =
convention in Philadelphia next month.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers -

In less than one month, we are going to take our political revolution into =
the halls of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia and make =
our voices heard that this moment in our nation's history demands a =
Democratic Party that puts working families ahead of wealthy campaign =
contributors.

Our campaign has earned the right to send almost 1,900 delegates to the =
convention, where they will vote on matters as important as rule changes =
to abolish superdelegates and amendments to the official Democratic Party =
platform.

But our delegates are working folks, and for many of them, the costs of =
attending the convention are too high. So I want to help them get there, =
because this campaign isn't about Bernie Sanders, it's about all of us. =
And when the convention votes on issues like a $15 minimum wage, stopping =
the TPP, and a ban on fracking, we're going to need every last one of our =
supporters speaking loudly on behalf of the values we share.

Can I count on you to make a $2.70 contribution today? Your donation, =
along with thousands being made right now, will go directly towards =
ensuring we can get every last one of our delegates to Philadelphia for =
the convention next month.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/final_fec_deadline

Our power comes from a simple, timeless truth: that when people stand =
together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish. And I know that if we =
continue to fight to get all of our sisters and brothers to Philadelphia =
next month, we are going to transform the Democratic Party.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters, Brothers, and Friends,

The world is going to have answers to two very important questions about =
our campaign in about three weeks.

1. Are we able to bring all of our nearly 1,900 delegates to the =
Democratic convention in Philadelphia, where with Bernie they will cast =
important votes for a progressive platform that includes issues like =
opposition to a vote against the disastrous TPP, or a $15 federal minimum =
wage?

2. Will the FEC fundraising report we must file days before the convention =
show that we have the momentum and the power to continue the incredible =
work of our political revolution?

I want the answers to both of those questions to be yes. The future of our =
movement depends on it. Can you help before the FEC deadline at midnight?

Make a $3 contribution to Bernie Sanders before tonight's FEC deadline and =
you will make sure all our delegates go to the convention and we'll show =
the continued strength of our political revolution:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/final_fec_deadline

When our delegates gather in Philadelphia, they'll have the chance to put =
the Democratic Party on the record about stopping votes against the TPP, =
fighting for a $15 federal minimum wage, opposing fracking, and so many =
more progressive priorities.

It's up to us to make it happen.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
Campaign Manager

Sisters and Brothers,

The corporate interests are at it again. Monsanto, agribusiness and the =
bio-tech industry have spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to =
overturn legislation passed by Vermont, Connecticut, Maine and Alaska that =
calls for the labeling of GMO food. In fact, they are moving aggressively =
now because Vermont's strong law goes into effect today.

This legislation is important because people have a right to know what is =
in the food they and their children eat. The more information we have, the =
better consumers we become. This is not a radical idea. It is why over 60 =
countries around the world have passed GMO labeling laws.

Unfortunately, the major agribusiness and bio-tech companies disagree. =
They do not believe people have a right to know what's in the food they =
eat. That is why they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in =
lobbying and campaign contributions to overturn the GMO right-to-know =
legislation that states have already passed and that many other states are =
on the verge of passing.

A bill in the Senate would overrule Vermont's law, and prevent states from =
passing similar laws. This bill, introduced by Senators Pat Roberts (R-KS) =
and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) will be coming up for a vote on Wednesday or =
Thursday of next week. It must be defeated.

Can you write to your senators today and ask them to oppose the GMO bill? =
You can click here and we'll direct you to write your senators =
immediately:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/speakout/stop-the-gmo-labeling-bill

Their goal is to deny states the right to go forward in this area and to =
pass legislation that is useless and with no value to consumers. And, if =
we don't stop them, they may just succeed.

On Thursday evening, with no hearings and no debate, a corporate-backed =
bill was introduced on to the floor by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

This legislation would create a confusing, misleading and unenforceable =
national standard for labeling GMOs. Instead of a uniform labeling =
standard like Vermont's law, the language allows text, symbols, or an =
electronic code to be used. This is intentionally confusing to consumers, =
and the information may be entirely inaccessible if the consumer does not =
have access to the internet.

Perhaps most shockingly, this bill imposes no penalties whatsoever for =
violating the labeling requirement, making the law essentially =
meaningless. Thus, this is a weak bill, full of loopholes, without any =
requirement to comply.

The issue of labeling our food isn't controversial. The overwhelming =
majority of Americans favor GMO labeling. People have a right to know what =
is in the food they eat. The Senate shouldn't stop states from passing =
laws that let that happen.

Congress must stand up to the demands of Monsanto and other multi-national =
food industry corporations and reject this outrageous, weak, and confusing =
bill. I will continue to do my best to defeat it, and take the necessary =
action to protect Vermont's GMO labeling efforts. But I need you with me =
in order to ensure its defeat.

Click here to write to your senators today and say that you want them to =
oppose this GMO labeling bill:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/speakout/stop-the-gmo-labeling-bill

States should be able to decide for themselves - without multinational =
corporations getting involved - if they want their food to be labeled.

Thanks for standing up to Monsanto on this issue.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Friday is important, sisters and brothers. That's our next chance before =
the Democratic convention to make sure that preventing the disastrous TPP =
trade agreement from getting a vote in Congress is part of the Democratic =
Party platform.

We're going to work hard for the Democratic Party to forcefully reject =
this job-killing trade deal, but we need your help to do so.

Here's the amendment we are offering when the platform committee meets =
again on July 8 in Orlando, Florida. We still need your signature to =
endorse this amendment. Add yours now before it's too late.

Our Amendment to the Democratic Party platform:
"It is the policy of the Democratic Party that the Trans-Pacific =
Partnership must not get a vote in this Congress or in future sessions of =
Congress."

ADD YOUR NAME =C2=BB https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/tpp-dnc

We're fighting to include this amendment to the Democratic Party platform =
because we want to prevent the outsourcing of jobs, protect the =
environment, stop pharmaceutical companies from increasing the price of =
prescription drugs, preserve our democracy, and respect human rights.

If we succeed, we will be in a very strong position to stop a vote on the =
TPP and to fundamentally rewrite our trade agreements to end the race to =
the bottom and lift up the living standards of people in this country and =
throughout the world.

Our next shot at winning this is at the platform meeting in Orlando on =
Friday.

Winning this fight starts with adding your name to say you want the =
Democratic Party platform to oppose a vote on the disastrous TPP. Click =
here to add your name now.

Sisters and Brothers,

I am writing you today to express my deep pride in the movement - the =
political revolution - you and I have created together over the last 15 =
months. When we began this historic campaign, we were considered fringe =
players by the political, economic and media establishment. Well, we =
proved them wrong.

We showed that the American people support a bold, progressive agenda that =
takes on the billionaire class, that fights for racial, social, economic =
and environmental justice and that seeks to create a government that works =
for all of us and not just the big campaign donors.

We mobilized over 13 million voters across the country. We won 23 =
Democratic primary and caucus contests. We had literally hundreds of =
thousands of volunteers across the country. And we showed - in a way that =
can change politics in America forever - that you can run a competitive =
national grassroots campaign without begging millionaires and billionaires =
for campaign contributions.

Most importantly, we elevated the critical issues facing our country - =
issues the establishment has pushed under the rug for too long. We focused =
attention on the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in this =
country and the importance of breaking up the large banks who brought our =
economy to the brink of collapse. We exposed our horrendous trade =
policies, our broken criminal justice system, and our people's lack of =
access to affordable health care and higher education. We fought =
aggressively to address the crisis of climate change, the need for real =
comprehensive immigration reform, the importance of developing a foreign =
policy that values diplomacy over war, and so much more.

We have shown throughout this election that these are issues that are =
important to voters and that progressive solutions energize people in the =
fight for real change. What we have accomplished so far is historic - but =
our work is far from over.

This movement of ours - this political revolution - must continue. We =
cannot let all of the momentum we have achieved in the fight to transform =
America be lost. We will never stop fighting for what is right.

It is true that in terms of winning the Democratic nomination, we did come =
up short. But this election was never about me or any candidate. It was =
about the powerful coming together of millions of people to take their =
country back from the billionaire class. That was the strength of our =
campaign and it will be the strength of our movement going forward in the =
months and years ahead.

In the coming weeks, I will be announcing the creation of successor =
organizations to carry on the struggle that we have been a part of these =
past 15 months. I hope you will continue to be involved in fighting to =
transform America. Our goal will be to advance the progressive agenda that =
we believe in and to elect like-minded candidates at the federal, state =
and local levels who are committed to accomplishing our goals.

In terms of the presidential election this November, there is no doubt =
that the election of Donald Trump as president would be a devastating blow =
to all that we are fighting for. His openly bigoted and pro-billionaire =
campaign could precipitate the same decades-long rightward shift in =
American politics that happened after the election of Ronald Reagan in =
1980. That rightward shift after Reagan's election infected not just =
politics as a whole but led to the ascendancy of the corporatist wing of =
the Democratic Party - an era from which we are still recovering.

I cannot in good conscience let that happen.

To have all of the work we have done in elevating our progressive ideals =
be dashed away by a complete Republican takeover of Washington - a =
takeover headed by a candidate that demonizes Latinos, Muslims, women, =
African Americans, veterans, and others - would be unthinkable.

Today, I endorsed Hillary Clinton to be our next president. I know that =
some of you will be disappointed with that decision. But I believe that, =
at this moment, our country, our values, and our common vision for a =
transformed America, are best served by the defeat of Donald Trump and the =
election of Hillary Clinton.

You should know that in the weeks since the last primary, both campaigns =
have worked together in good faith to bridge some of the policy issues =
that divided us during the election. Did we come to agreement on =
everything? Of course not. But we made important steps forward.

Hillary Clinton released a debt free college plan that we developed =
together which now includes free tuition at public colleges and =
universities for working families. This was a major part of our campaign's =
agenda and a proposal that, if enacted into law, would revolutionize =
higher education in this country.

Secretary Clinton has also publicly committed to massive investments in =
health care for communities across this country that will increase primary =
care, including mental health care, dental care, and low-cost prescription =
drug access for an additional 25 million people. Importantly, she has also =
endorsed the enactment of a so-called public option to allow everyone in =
this country to participate in a public insurance program. This idea was =
killed by the insurance industry during consideration of President Obama's =
health care program.

During the Democratic platform proceedings in St. Louis and Orlando, we =
were victorious in including amendments to make it a clear priority of the =
Democratic Party to fight for a $15 an hour federal minimum wage, expand =
Social Security, abolish the death penalty, put a price on carbon, =
establish a path toward the legalization of marijuana, enact major =
criminal justice reforms, pass comprehensive immigration reform, end =
for-profit prisons and detention facilities, break up too-big-to-fail =
banks and create a 21st century Glass-Steagall Act, close loopholes that =
allow big companies to avoid taxes by stashing their cash in offshore tax =
havens and use that revenue to rebuild America, approve the most expansive =
agenda ever for protecting Native American rights and so much more.

All of these progressive policies were at the heart of our campaign. The =
truth is our movement is responsible for the most progressive Democratic =
platform in the history of our country. All of that is the direct result =
of the work that our members of the platform committee did in the meetings =
and that you have been doing over the last 15 months.

But none of these initiatives will happen if we do not elect a Democratic =
president in November. None! In fact, we will go backward. We must elect =
the Democratic nominee in November and progressive Democrats up and down =
the ballot so that we ensure that these policy commitments can advance.

It is extremely important that we keep our movement together, that we hold =
public officials accountable and that we elect progressive candidates to =
office at the federal, state, and local level who will stand with us.

As part of that effort, we still have a tremendous amount of work left to =
do in the Democratic Rules Committee that will be meeting in the coming =
weeks. We have to enact the kinds of reforms to the Democratic Party and =
to the electoral process that will provide us the tools to elect =
progressive candidates, to allow new voices and new energy into the Party, =
and to break up the excessive power that the economic and political elites =
in the Party currently have. As with our fights on the platform committee, =
that will only be possible if we stand together.

You should know that I intend to be actively campaigning throughout this =
election season to elect candidates who will stand by our agenda. I hope =
to see many of you at events from coast to coast.

In conclusion, I again want to express my pride in what we have =
accomplished together over the last year. But so much more must be done to =
make our vision a reality. Now more than ever our country needs our =
movement - our political revolution. As you have throughout this historic =
campaign, I ask for your ongoing support as we continue through the fall =
and beyond.

On a personal note, I cannot say with words how appreciative Jane and I =
are of the kindness, dedication and love we experienced from so many =
people across the country. We are deeply touched by it and will never, =
ever forget it.

Please let me know that you will stand with me to defeat Donald Trump, and =
to elect candidates who will stand by our agenda as part of the future of =
our political revolution. Add your name now:

	Sisters and Brothers,</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	I am writing you today to express my deep pride in the movement &ndash; =
the political revolution &ndash; you and I have created together over the =
last 15 months. When we began this historic campaign, we were considered =
fringe players by the political, economic and media establishment. Well, =
we proved them wrong.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	We showed that the American people support a bold, progressive agenda =
that takes on the billionaire class, that fights for racial, social, =
economic and environmental justice and that seeks to create a government =
that works for all of us and not just the big campaign donors.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	We mobilized over 13 million voters across the country. We won 23 =
Democratic primary and caucus contests. We had literally hundreds of =
thousands of volunteers across the country. And we showed &ndash; in a way =
that can change politics in America forever &ndash; that you can run a =
competitive national grassroots campaign without begging millionaires and =
billionaires for campaign contributions.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	Most importantly, we elevated the critical issues facing our country =
&ndash; issues the establishment has pushed under the rug for too long. We =
focused attention on the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality =
in this country and the importance of breaking up the large banks who =
brought our economy to the brink of collapse. We exposed our horrendous =
trade policies, our broken criminal justice system, and our people's lack =
of access to affordable health care and higher education. We fought =
aggressively to address the crisis of climate change, the need for real =

Sisters and Brothers,

Thank you for everything you have done for the Political Revolution.

As you know, our campaign has always been about a grassroots movement of =
Americans standing up and saying: "Enough is enough. This country and our =
government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires."

Tonight I'm going to speak to the Democratic National Convention about all =
that we did together in our campaign, about the future of our country, and =
about the need for our grassroots movement to continue the struggle.

Say you'll watch my address tonight to the Democratic National Convention:

https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/convention-speech

I hope you'll tune in. It will be a very important address that will talk =
about not just why we must defeat Donald Trump, the worst presidential =
candidate in the modern history of our country, but how we will work =
together beyond this election to continue our political revolution.

What we have accomplished so far is nothing short of astonishing. When we =
began our campaign we were considered "fringe" and irrelevant by the =
pundits and the media. Well, 13 million votes later it appears that we =
have begun the process of transforming our country and radically changing =
the political landscape. We have made history, and you helped make that =
happen.

Taking on virtually the entire political establishment, you helped us win =
primary and caucus elections in 23 contests and send nearly 1900 delegates =
to this Democratic convention. In a race in which everyone expected us to =
be outraised and outspent, you made more grassroots contributions than any =
primary campaign ever and proved that we could run a presidential campaign =
without begging millionaires and billionaires for money. Some of the =
wealthiest people in the world were prepared to spend billions of dollars =
to stop you.

You built a grassroots organization that rivals anything seen before in =
our country, knocking on millions of doors, making tens of millions of =
phone calls, and building immense power in your communities.

You brought the issues of universal healthcare, combating climate change, =
free college tuition, a $15 minimum wage, and so many more progressive =
issues to the forefront of the race for president.

But you did more than just make those issues part of the debate - you have =
changed the policy platform of the Democratic Party and of Secretary =
Hillary Clinton's campaign.

Because of our tireless work the Democratic Party has just passed the most =
progressive platform, by far, in the history of the party. Secretary =
Clinton now says that she will oppose the disastrous Trans Pacific =
Partnership trade deal. She has also embraced parts of our plan to make =
college tuition free - and if her new plan passes, it could revolutionize =
the way higher education is funded in our country. Secretary Clinton has =
also embraced the public option for health insurance, and now supports =
significantly increased funding for community health centers. She adopted =
these positions because of you and your organizing.

It is critically important that we do not let up in our fight for a =
political revolution. Tonight at the Democratic National Convention I will =
address the future of Our Revolution, and I hope you will both tune in to =
watch, and join our effort after.

Thank you for being a part of the continued political revolution.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Sisters and Brothers,

Our campaign has always been about a grassroots movement of Americans =
standing up and saying: "Enough is enough. This country and our government =
belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires."

I just finished speaking at the Democratic National Convention, where I =
addressed the historic nature of our grassroots movement and what's next =
for our political revolution.

I hope that I made you proud. I know that Jane and I are very proud of =
you.

Our work will continue in the form of a new group called Our Revolution. =
The goal of this organization will be no different from the goal of our =
campaign: we must transform American politics to make our political and =
economic systems once again responsive to the needs of working families.

We cannot do this alone. All of us must be a part of Our Revolution.

Join Our Revolution and help continue our critical work to create a =
government which represents all of us, and not just the 1 percent - a =
government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and =
environmental justice. Add your name here:

https://ourrevolution.com/

When we started this campaign a little more than a year ago, the media and =
the political establishment considered us to be a "fringe" campaign. Well, =
we're not fringe anymore.

Thanks to your tireless work and generous contributions, we won 23 =
primaries and caucuses with more than 13 million votes, all of which led =
to the 1900 delegates we have on the floor this week at the Democratic =
convention.

What we have done together is absolutely unprecedented, but there is so =
much more to do. It starts with defeating Donald Trump in November, and =
then continuing to fight for every single one of our issues in order to =
transform America.

We are going to fight to make sure that the most progressive platform in =
the history of the Democratic Party becomes law. This means working for a =
$15 federal minimum wage, fighting for a national fracking ban, and so =
many more progressive priorities.

The political revolution needs you in order to make all this happen and =
more.

Add your name to say that you will join Our Revolution and be part of the =
fight for our progressive vision for America:

https://ourrevolution.com/

Thank you for being a part of the continued political revolution.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

	Sisters and Brothers,</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	Our campaign has always been about a grassroots movement of Americans =
standing up and saying: "Enough is enough. This country and our government =
belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires."</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	I just finished speaking at the Democratic National Convention, where I =
addressed the historic nature of our grassroots movement and what's next =
for our political revolution.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	I hope that I made you proud. I know that Jane and I are very proud of =
you.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	<strong>Our work will continue in the form of a new group called Our =
Revolution.</strong> The goal of this organization will be no different =
from the goal of our campaign: we must transform American politics to make =
our political and economic systems once again responsive to the needs of =
working families.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	<strong>We cannot do this alone. All of us must be a part of Our =
Revolution.</strong></p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	<a href=3D"https://ourrevolution.com/" =
style=3D"text-decoration:underline;" =
title=3D"https://ourrevolution.com/"><strong>Join Our Revolution and help =
continue our critical work to create a government which represents all of =
us, and not just the 1 percent &ndash; a government based on the =
principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice. Add your =
name here.</strong></a></p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	When we started this campaign a little more than a year ago, the media =
and the political establishment considered us to be a "fringe" campaign. =
Well, we're not fringe anymore.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	Thanks to your tireless work and generous contributions, we won 23 =
primaries and caucuses with more than 13 million votes, all of which led =
to the 1900 delegates we have on the floor this week at the Democratic =
convention.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	What we have done together is absolutely unprecedented, but there is so =
much more to do. It starts with defeating Donald Trump in November, and =
then continuing to fight for every single one of our issues in order to =
transform America.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	We are going to fight to make sure that the most progressive platform in =
the history of the Democratic Party becomes law. This means working for a =
$15 federal minimum wage, fighting for a national fracking ban, and so =
many more progressive priorities.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
	The political revolution needs you in order to make all this happen and =
more.</p>

Sisters, Brothers, and Friends,

Election days come and go, but the struggle for economic, social, racial =
and environmental justice continues. Together, we built something special =
and unprecedented through our presidential campaign. Now, we are going to =
take the next steps forward towards our political revolution.=20

We are building a new organization called Our Revolution. Our goal will be =
the same as in our campaign: we must work to transform American society by =
making our political and economic systems work for all of us, not just the =
one percent.=20

Can you make a $3 contribution to Our Revolution so that we can continue =
our critical work to take back our country from the billionaire class? =
Make your contribution here: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/tr=
ansform-america?refcode=3Dem160803

On the very first day of our campaign, I wrote to my supporters and said, =
"This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It's about a grassroots =
movement of Americans standing up and saying: 'Enough is enough. This =
country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of =
billionaires.'"=20

That is as true today as it was then. That is why Our Revolution will =
focus on three distinct areas of work:=09

1. Revitalizing American democracy by bringing millions of working people =
and young people into the political system.=20

2. Empowering the next generation of progressive leaders by inspiring, =
recruiting and supporting progressive candidates across the entire =
spectrum of government - from school board to the U.S. Senate.=20

3. Doing what the corporate media does not do: elevating political =
consciousness by educating the public about the most pressing issues =
confronting our nation and the bold solutions needed to address them.=20

Together we can revitalize our democracy, empower new progressive leaders, =
and educate the public about the critical issues facing our country. To =
get started, I need your help. Will you join me?=20

Add a $3 contribution to Our Revolution and be one of the first to join =
this next phase of our movement: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/pag=
e/transform-america?refcode=3Dem160803

We have a lot to do together and I'm glad you're with me.=20

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Many of you already know that I've endorsed a candidate Tim Canova who is =
challenging the former head of the Democratic Party Debbie Wasserman =
Schultz in Florida.

This race is very important for Our Revolution because if we can win this =
tough fight in Florida, it will send a clear message about the power of =
our grassroots movement that will send shockwaves through the political =
and media establishments. The latest poll shows us within reach.

July 31 Poll
Debbie Wasserman Schultz: 46%
Tim Canova: 38%
Undecided: 16%

This is going to be close. Please chip in $3 to Tim Canova's campaign so =
that we can get as many voters to the polls as possible before the August =
30th primary. Donate: =
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/canova-dws

Much like in our campaign for president, Tim started off as a major =
underdog in this race, battling a well-known and well-established person =
who was the chairwoman of the Democratic Party.

He is running a tough campaign on the kind of progressive platform we need =
to see in this country: opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, backing =
free tuition at public colleges and universities, reforming a corrupt =
campaign finance system and raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Tim =
is on the side of working people and that's why we need to help him win.

Please make an urgent $3 contribution to Tim Canova's campaign today so =
his campaign can put it to use before the primary against Debbie Wasserman =
Schultz on August 30th. Donate: =
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/canova-dws

The recent emails leaked from Democratic Party staff showed that under =
Debbie Wasserman Schultz, DNC staff were not exactly fair and even-minded =
during the presidential primary. What was revealed wasn't much of a shock =
to us, because we knew all along that the establishment wasn't on our =
side.

But now that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has resigned we have the opportunity =
to transform the Democratic Party and open up its doors to working people =
and young people -- people who want real change. Democrats must make it =
crystal clear that their party is prepared to take on Wall Street and the =
powerful corporate interests whose greed is doing so much harm to our =
country. We must stand with Americans who are working longer hours for =
lower wages, the uninsured, students leaving school deeply in debt and all =
those worried about climate change.

I believe Tim Canova is the kind of candidate whose policies will move the =
Democratic Party and our country in that direction. Electing Tim will send =
a strong message to the Democratic establishment about what this party =
should stand for. That's why I'm asking you today to help send him to =
Congress:

Can you rush a $3 contribution to Tim Canova's campaign today before this =
critical primary against Debbie Wasserman Schultz on August 30th? Donate: =
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/canova-dws

This race has been an uphill battle from the very beginning, but the =
latest poll has us very close. I am confident we can win this fight with =
your support.

Thank you for being a part of Our Revolution.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

 The political revolution was never just about electing a president. It's =
a movement of millions of Americans uniting to upend the status quo and =
transform our country. That's why we're coming together around dozens of =
strong candidates -- from school board to Senate -- to win important =
victories on November 8th.

We need to elect a wave of progressive candidates all over this country =
who will fight for the values we share, and that's why I'm asking you =
today to support three people who have long stood with our political =
revolution:

Make a $2.70 contribution right now to help elect three strong =
progressives who support our movement: Zephyr Teachout, Rick Nolan and =
Pramila Jayapal.

These candidates endorsed Bernie's campaign for president because they =
believe in our political revolution. They had the guts to take on the =
establishment when it wasn't necessarily going to be easy and we know they =
will be strong and consistent allies in the fight for economic, social, =
environmental and racial justice in the House of Representatives.

Zephyr Teachout (New York): Zephyr is running in a swing district, but =
she's running on a progressive agenda that will win working people on both =
sides of the aisle. Zephyr wrote a book on political corruption because =
she understands deeply how wealthy campaign contributors are buying our =
politicians and rigging our economy. In Congress, she'll fight to ban =
fracking and rein in Wall Street. This won't be an easy race and she needs =
your financial support.

Rick Nolan (Minnesota): Rick represents one of the most competitive =
congressional districts in the country, but he's been a strong fighter for =
enacting single-payer health care, overturning Citizens United and ending =
offshore tax havens. He's running against a multimillionaire CEO who =
thinks he can pour millions into television ads, win himself a =
congressional seat, and then cast votes to cut taxes on the ultra-rich.

Pramila Jayapal (Washington): Pramila was a leader in the fight for paid =
sick leave and a $15 minimum wage in Seattle. She's been taking on the =
ruling class in Washington state for years, and now we need to make sure =
she gets past a tough general election so that she can be one of our =
strongest allies in Congress.

Let's win these races. Make a $2.70 contribution right now to elect these =
progressives who are going to fight for our revolution in Congress.

CONTRIBUTE: =
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-revolution-house

I believe that when future historians look back and describe how our =
country moved forward and created a government which represents all people =
and not just the few, they will note that, to a significant degree, that =
effort began with the political revolution of 2016 and the tidal wave of =
strong leaders we elected all over the country.

Thank you for all you're doing to power our movement. Let's keep it going.

In solidarity,

Shannon Jackson

Thanks to all of your hard work in our campaign this past year we have =
transformed American politics. On issue after issue -- making college =
affordable, progressive taxation, climate change, trade and many others -- =
more and more Americans are agreeing with us. People are ready to take on =
the 1 percent.

During our campaign we assembled a movement of millions of people ready to =
fight for the country we know we can become. Election days come and go, =
but the struggle for economic, social, racial and environmental justice =
must continue. We have the guts and the energy to take on the special =
interests, win critical battles on the most important issues of our time, =
and redefine what's possible in this country. Now it's time for all of us =
to get to work. Please be part of our new organization, Our Revolution.

On August 24 at 9pm ET / 6pm PT, I will address our national network of =
volunteers live at more than 2,000 organizing meetings across the country. =
Please attend one of those meetings in your area so you can get involved =
in the next steps for Our Revolution:

FIND AN EVENT NEAR YOU: http://map.berniesanders.com

At this meeting, I and others will lay out some of the next steps we can =
take as a movement to empower a wave of progressive candidates this =
November and win the major upcoming fights for the values we share. We'll =
also talk about how you can be a key movement builder in your community =
for Our Revolution.=20

I sincerely hope you'll join us and RSVP for one the events nearest to you =
on August 24th. It's going to be an exciting evening for all of us.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

	Thanks to all of your hard work in our campaign this past year we have =
transformed American politics. On issue after issue &mdash; making college =
affordable, progressive taxation, climate change, trade and many others =
&mdash; more and more Americans are agreeing with us. People are ready to =
take on the 1 percent.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	During our campaign we assembled a movement of millions of people ready =
to fight for the country we know we can become. Election days come and go, =
but the struggle for economic, social, racial and environmental justice =
must continue. We have the guts and the energy to take on the special =
interests, win critical battles on the most important issues of our time, =
and redefine what's possible in this country. Now it's time for all of us =
to get to work. Please be part of our new organization, Our =
Revolution.</p>

Sisters and Brothers,

As a result of your activism, our political revolution is responsible for =
the most progressive Democratic platform in the history of our country. We =
were victorious in making it a clear priority of the Democratic Party to =
fight for a $15 an hour federal minimum wage, expand Social Security, =
abolish the death penalty, put a price on carbon, enact major criminal =
justice reforms, end for-profit prisons and detention facilities, break up =
too-big-to-fail banks and create a 21st century Glass-Steagall Act, and so =
much more.

And just the other day, the Republican leadership in the Senate announced =
that the TPP would not be coming to the floor this year. Another major =
victory.

All of that is the direct result of the grassroots activism that you, and =
millions of others, engaged in over the last 16 months. Now, we must =
continue our efforts by electing progressive Democrats up and down the =
ballot so that the policies we have fought for can advance and become law.

For the future of our country, and our progressive agenda, it is =
imperative that Democrats regain control of the Senate. My guess is that =
will all come down to which party wins three or four hotly contested races =
in states like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio and Nevada.

The Koch brothers know this. That is why they are spending tens of =
millions of dollars to defeat these four candidates for Senate.

And that's why I'm asking you to support them: Katie McGinty in =
Pennsylvania, Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, Ted Strickland in Ohio, and =
Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada. If these four Democrats win the tight =
elections they are currently in, the Democrats will almost certainly take =
control of the Senate.

And what a world of difference that will make: real campaign finance =
reform, raising the minimum wage, making public colleges and universities =
tuition free, addressing the planetary crisis of climate change, =
progressive taxation, reforming our broken criminal justice system, =
comprehensive immigration reform and many other important issues.

Split a $3 contribution to help Katie McGinty, Maggie Hassan, Ted =
Strickland, and Catherine Cortez Masto become senators and take back a =
majority in the Senate:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/us_senate_slate

I want to be clear: It is very important that our movement holds public =
officials accountable. The Democratic Party passed an extremely =
progressive agenda at the convention. Our job is to make sure that =
platform is implemented. That will not happen without Democratic control =
of the Senate.

- Katie McGinty was one of the first candidates to endorse a $15 minimum =
wage.
- Maggie Hassan, who is a strong supporter of campaign finance reform, =
increased transparency and disclosure of political contributions as =
Governor of New Hampshire.
- Ted Strickland is a fighter for Ohio's working families who opposes the =
TPP and believes that we need to completely change the way we negotiate =
trade deals.
- Catherine Cortez Masto is committed to protecting the environment and =
knows it's long past time that we ensure equal pay for women.

Perhaps the most important reason to win a majority in the Senate is =
because we must support nominees for the Supreme Court who will vote to =
overturn Citizens United.

It is so important we do everything we can to help these four candidates - =
Katie McGinty in Pennsylvania, Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, Ted =
Strickland in Ohio, and Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada - win their =
elections in November.

Your contribution of $3 will help each of these candidates for Senate win. =
Please split a contribution between them today so we can advance our =
progressive agenda, defeat the Koch brothers, and take back the Senate:

	Sisters and Brothers,</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	As a result of your activism, our political revolution is responsible for =
the most progressive Democratic platform in the history of our country. We =
were victorious in making it a clear priority of the Democratic Party to =
fight for a $15 an hour federal minimum wage, expand Social Security, =
abolish the death penalty, put a price on carbon, enact major criminal =
justice reforms, end for-profit prisons and detention facilities, break up =
too-big-to-fail banks and create a 21st century Glass-Steagall Act, and so =
much more.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	And just the other day, the Republican leadership in the Senate announced =
that the TPP would not be coming to the floor this year. Another major =
victory.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	All of that is the direct result of the grassroots activism that you, and =
millions of others, engaged in over the last 16 months. Now, we must =
continue our efforts by electing progressive Democrats up and down the =
ballot so that the policies we have fought for can advance and become =
law.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	<strong>For the future of our country, and our progressive agenda, it is =
imperative that Democrats regain control of the Senate. My guess is that =
will all come down to which party wins three or four hotly contested races =
in states like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio and Nevada.</strong></p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	The Koch brothers know this. That is why they are spending tens of =
millions of dollars to defeat these four candidates for Senate.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	And that's why I'm asking you to support them: Katie McGinty in =
Pennsylvania, Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, Ted Strickland in Ohio, and =
Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada. If these four Democrats win the tight =
elections they are currently in, the Democrats will almost certainly take =
control of the Senate.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size:17px; line-height:140%;">
	And what a world of difference that will make: real campaign finance =
reform, raising the minimum wage, making public colleges and universities =
tuition free, addressing the planetary crisis of climate change, =
progressive taxation, reforming our broken criminal justice system, =
comprehensive immigration reform and many other important issues.</p>

Sisters and Brothers,

Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan issued a very dire warning this =
week. You need to see it:

"If we lose the Senate, do you know who becomes chair of the Senate Budget =
Committee? A guy named Bernie Sanders. You ever heard of him?"

You heard the man. Let's take back the Senate.

Four of our best opportunities to take back the Senate are in Nevada, New =
Hampshire, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. Each race is incredibly =
close. But if the Democratic nominees win, we will have a far more =
progressive Senate - and a majority to enact our progressive agenda.

The final FEC fundraising deadline of the campaign is Wednesday at =
midnight. Split a $4 contribution now between Catherine Cortez-Masto, =
Maggie Hassan, Deborah Ross, and Katie McGinty before tomorrow's deadline:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/progressive-senate?refcode=3Dem=
161018-pt

How close are these races? The latest poll averages have Deborah Ross down =
by just two points in North Carolina. In Nevada, Catherine Cortez-Masto is =
up by two. Maggie Hassan is down by a little more than two points in New =
Hampshire. And in the tightest race of all, Katie McGinty is up by less =
than a half percent in Pennsylvania.

Four Senate seats we need for a majority. Four dedicated leaders who could =
serve with Bernie Sanders. At most a two percent difference in the polls =
for every race.

Your contributions can be the difference between victory and defeat in =
each of these elections. Small-dollar contributions from emails like this =
can push Catherine Cortez-Masto, Deborah Ross, Maggie Hassan, and Katie =
McGinty over the top on election day.

With tomorrow's FINAL fundraising deadline for the FEC, the time is now =
for us to step up and help take back a Senate majority.

Split a $4 contribution between the campaigns of Catherine Cortez-Masto, =
Deborah Ross, Maggie Hassan, and Katie McGinty before tomorrow's deadline:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/progressive-senate?refcode=3Dem=
161018-pt

You can make the difference in this election to take back a Senate =
majority. Thank you.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver

Sisters and Brothers: Since earlier today, 10,000 people have donated more =
than $400,000 to Catherine Cortez Masto, Deborah Ross, Maggie Hassan, and =
Katie McGinty.

That's how much people want Paul Ryan's warning about Bernie Sanders =
becoming chair of the budget committee to become true.

What you're doing for these candidates is yuuuge. It's game-changing for =
their campaigns. But there's still more to do, because we can do more than =
just take back the Senate. We have a chance to take back the House. It =
starts with helping candidates for Congress who are inspired by the =
political revolution.

So we're going to set an audacious goal that we don't know is possible to =
hit by tomorrow night's final FEC fundraising deadline - but it's one that =
is very important to try to reach.

Let's raise $1 million for candidates for the House and Senate by =
tomorrow's final FEC fundraising deadline of the campaign. Split a $3 =
contribution between Deborah Ross, Zephyr Teachout, Nanette Barragan, Tom =
Nelson, Pramila Jayapal, Rick Nolan, and Morgan Carroll.

Adding a contribution to these candidates - even if you've already =
supported them - is so important right now. Every poll shows these races =
within a handful of percentage points. And every contribution you make to =
these candidates will go to the critical work of communicating with voters =
and organizing for Election Day.

We don't know if we can reach $1 million for House and Senate candidates =
tomorrow. But it's very important that we try.

If you can, add a $3 contribution to reach our goal:

Sisters and Brothers,

I heard what Paul Ryan said about me: that if the Republicans lose the =
Senate, I will be the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.

That sounds like a very good idea to me. It means that we can establish =
priorities for working people, and not just the billionaire class.

What would be equally exciting is if the Democrats took back the House, =
and Congressman Ryan was no longer Speaker. That would mean the clearest =
possible path to enact our agenda - the most progressive agenda of any =
party in American history.

In the last day, you have responded tremendously to our call to support =
four leaders who will help shift the balance of the Senate. More than =
20,000 people have contributed more than $900,000 to ten candidates who =
are inspired by the political revolution.

During our campaign we pushed ourselves to reach goals that many thought =
impossible. That is why we set a very big, very audacious goal that we =
didn't know if we could reach, but that we thought it was very important =
to try. But you're about to smash that $1 million goal.

So, we're going to need a bigger goal.

Let's raise $2 million before tonight's final FEC deadline of the campaign =
for candidates for the House and Senate. Can you start with a contribution =
between Paul Clements, Catherine Cortez-Masto, Deborah Ross, Zephyr =
Teachout, Morgan Carroll, Nanette Barragan, and Rick Nolan?

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/big-goals?refcode=3Dem161019-pt

Consider for a moment the power that exists in the U.S. Senate. Right now, =
the Republican majority is using their power to block any meaningful =
action on addressing income inequality or climate change. In addition, =
without a Democratic majority the Senate is refusing to confirm federal =
judges and, incredibly, has left open a critical seat on the Supreme =
Court.

With a Democratic majority, we can change all of that. What Paul Ryan is =
specifically afraid of is the power of the budget committee. That =
committee defines the spending priorities of the entire government. The =
work of that committee says how much revenue the government should have, =
and where its money should go.

I have some thoughts on how the government should allocate its spending. =
I'm sure you do, too.

The first step to being able to enact our progressive agenda is taking =
back the Senate. And if we take back the House... well, the sky is the =
limit for what we can achieve.

Help us reach for our new, audacious goal of raising $2 million for =
candidates for the House and Senate by midnight tonight. Add a =
contribution now split between Paul Clements, Catherine Cortez-Masto, =
Deborah Ross, Zephyr Teachout, Morgan Carroll, Nanette Barragan, and Rick =
Nolan:

Thank you for all you do.

Bernie Sanders

Our midnight goal will help take back power from the billionaire class

Bernie Sanders is supporting 13 incredible leaders for the House and =
Senate this year. We're trying to raise $2 million in two days to support =
their campaigns before tonight's FINAL fundraising deadline of the =
election.

But we're still short of our goal.

Split a $3 contribution to the campaigns of Deborah Ross, Catherine Cortez =
Masto, Russ Feingold, Maggie Hassan, Katie McGinty, Paul Clements, Chase =
Iron Eyes, Rick Nolan, Nanette Barragan, Zephyr Teachout, Pramila Jayapal, =
Morgan Carroll, and Tom Nelson before midnight:

Here's something we bet you're thinking right now, sisters and brothers. =
We bet this final presidential debate really makes you want to have the =
most progressive Congress possible next year.

Imagine a Congress that has a Democratic majority in the Senate, and =
Bernie Sanders with a gavel in his hand. We'd have Elizabeth Warren in the =
Senate majority, and maybe even a majority in the House of =
Representatives. But first, we have to win in November.

We're making huge progress towards our goal of raising $2 million in two =
days for House and Senate candidates, but we're still short of our goal =
before tonight's final fundraising deadline.

Can you split a $3 contribution between Deborah Ross, Catherine Cortez =
Masto, Russ Feingold, Maggie Hassan, Katie McGinty, Paul Clements, Chase =
Iron Eyes, Rick Nolan, Nanette Barragan, Zephyr Teachout, Pramila Jayapal, =
Morgan Carroll, and Tom Nelson before midnight?

Sisters and Brothers,

It looks like you got Paul Ryan's attention. And he's not happy.

The Speaker of the House forwarded the email Bernie sent to you to his =
entire fundraising list. You can see what he said below.

Paul Ryan really doesn't like that you donated more than $1.8 million in =
two days to take back the House and Senate (which is an AMAZING feat, and =
something for which we are so grateful). He even put in a big, red button =
when he forwarded Bernie's email that says "HELP STOP SANDERS."

We've got their attention. Now let's show what we really can do.

Split a $3 contribution between Bernie's thirteen candidates for the House =
and Senate so we can take back Congress, make Bernie a committee chairman =
in a Democratic Senate, and enact our progressive agenda.

The incredible contributions you've made in the last two days are =
completely changing the dynamics of these races for Congress. We are so =
grateful, because your support means campaigns can train more volunteers, =
talk to more voters, and turn out more people on Election Day.

Paul Ryan knows the tremendous impact you're having, and he's scared. =
Let's keep it going.

In solidarity,

Team Bernie

I spoke last week about what would happen if we lose our majority in =
Congress. It looks like Bernie Sanders was listening, because a staffer =
showed me the message he sent to his supporters yesterday....

Read it and find out why it is so important to hold the House and Senate =
this November.

Bottom line: we must stop Bernie Sanders, Nancy Pelosi, and the =
Progressive Democrats from taking over Congress. Please consider making a =
donation today to stop this dangerous, progressive agenda.

Help Stop Sanders

Thank you.

Let's do this,

Paul Ryan

Sisters and Brothers,

I heard what Paul Ryan said about me: that if the Republicans lose the =
Senate, I will be the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.

That sounds like a very good idea to me. It means that we can establish =
priorities for working people, and not just the billionaire class.

What would be equally exciting is if the Democrats took back the House, =
and Congressman Ryan was no longer Speaker. That would mean the clearest =
possible path to enact our agenda - the most progressive agenda of any =
party in American history.

In the last day, you have responded tremendously to our call to support =
four leaders who will help shift the balance of the Senate. More than =
20,000 people have contributed more than $900,000 to ten candidates who =
are inspired by the political revolution.

During our campaign we pushed ourselves to reach goals that many thought =
impossible. That is why we set a very big, very audacious goal that we =
didn't know if we could reach, but that we thought it was very important =
to try. But you're about to smash that $1 million goal.

So, we're going to need a bigger goal.

Let's raise $2 million before tonight's final FEC deadline of the campaign =
for candidates for the House and Senate. Can you start with a $3 =
contribution between Paul Clements, Catherine Cortez-Masto, Deborah Ross, =
Zephyr Teachout, Morgan Carroll, Nanette Barragan, and Rick Nolan?

Consider for a moment the power that exists in the U.S. Senate. Right now, =
the Republican majority is using their power to block any meaningful =
action on addressing income inequality or climate change. In addition, =
without a Democratic majority the Senate is refusing to confirm federal =
judges and, incredibly, has left open a critical seat on the Supreme =
Court.

With a Democratic majority, we can change all of that. What Paul Ryan is =
specifically afraid of is the power of the budget committee. That =
committee defines the spending priorities of the entire government. The =
work of that committee says how much revenue the government should have, =
and where its money should go.

I have some thoughts on how the government should allocate its spending. =
I'm sure you do, too.

The first step to being able to enact our progressive agenda is taking =
back the Senate. And if we take back the House... well, the sky is the =
limit for what we can achieve.

Help us reach for our new, audacious goal of raising $2 million for =
candidates for the House and Senate by midnight tonight. Add a $3 =
contribution now split between Paul Clements, Catherine Cortez-Masto, =
Deborah Ross, Zephyr Teachout, Morgan Carroll, Nanette Barragan, and Rick =
Nolan.

Thank you for all you do.

Sisters and Brothers,

Election Day is in two weeks, and we cannot allow the Koch brothers and =
other billionaires to buy elections throughout the country. Let's stand =
together and elect strong progressives who are fighting for real change - =
fighting to stand up for working families, the elderly, the children, the =
sick and the poor. Let's support candidates who are prepared to take on =
the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from coal =
and oil into energy efficiency and sustainable energy.

Our candidates are working hard and, in many cases, the polls show the =
races are very close. It is likely that the outcome will be decided by a =
few votes - one way or the other. Let's make sure that our candidates are =
on top.

I want to tell you about these candidates, their close races, and the =
billionaires trying to defeat them. But if you can contribute right now, =
please split a $3 contribution between the campaigns of Jane Kim, Sue =
Minter, David Zuckerman, Proposition 61 in California, and Eloise Reyes:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/billionaires-buying-elections?r=
efcode=3Dem161024-pt

In California, Jane Kim - one of the first candidates I endorsed, and who =
won her incredibly close primary because of your support - is facing an =
outrageous amount of outside spending in her race for state senate. =
Billionaire-funded groups have spent $500,000 attacking her in just the =
last three weeks, with more sure to come. Jane is a true progressive, and =
she can defeat the big money interests if we are prepared to stand behind =
her.

In my home state of Vermont, Sue Minter is the Democratic nominee for =
Governor. She will be a strong leader in making higher education tuition =
free for all, and in the struggle against climate change. But a new poll =
shows she is one point behind the Republican nominee, who is receiving =
strong support from billionaires around the country. In my view her =
running-mate David Zuckerman, a family farmer and food activist, will be =
the most progressive Lieutenant Governor in the country. He is an =
outstanding member of the state senate who has taken on powerful special =
interests throughout his career.

Proposition 61 in California would lower prescription drug prices and =
challenge the price gouging of Big Pharma. As you might imagine, drug =
companies don't like it very much. They are spending more than $100 =
million to defeat this initiative, and just added another $22 million last =
week. A victory in California against the greed of the pharmaceutical =
industry is a victory for all of us.

Big oil companies want to defeat Eloise Reyes in her race for state =
legislature in California. Chevron has donated millions of dollars to =
outside groups trying to defeat Reyes because they know she would hold =
them accountable in the fight against climate change.

With just 15 days until the election, we need your support to expand our =
political revolution. Great candidates are being overwhelmed with huge =
contributions from the Koch brothers and other billionaires. Let's fight =
back and help our candidates win.

Please split a $3 contribution between Jane Kim, Sue Minter, David =
Zuckerman, Proposition 61 in California, and Eloise Reyes:

Sisters and Brothers,

All across our country, as a result of the disastrous Supreme Court =
decision on Citizens United, billionaires are trying to buy elections for =
candidates who will represent the wealthy and the powerful.

There is no better example of this than in Wisconsin, where big money =
interests are spending millions to defeat progressive champion Russ =
Feingold. Russ, throughout his career, has led the effort for campaign =
finance reform, civil rights, the protection of our privacy and the needs =
of working people. He opposed the war in Iraq, led the effort against the =
Patriot Act and wants to see that the wealthy and large corporations pay =
their fair share of taxes.

It should be no surprise, therefore, that the Koch Brothers and the =
billionaire class want to keep Russ out of the Senate. The problem is, =
they're spending so much money in Wisconsin's Senate race that Russ could =
lose.

The billionaire class has already spent $7.5 million in outside spending =
to defeat Russ. He's seen his lead in the polls cut by more than half.

In my mind, this is exactly the kind of grotesque spending by millionaires =
and billionaires which is moving our country toward an oligarchic form of =
society. We need to overturn Citizens United, we need real campaign =
finance reform, and we need a progressive Senate.

We need to help Russ Feingold win his election, and that means all of us =
need to stand together right now to support Russ.

Please rush a $3 contribution DIRECTLY to Russ Feingold's campaign so that =
he can take on the billionaires trying to keep him out of the Senate:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/russ-feingold?refcode=3Dem16102=
8-pt

It is absolutely critical for Russ Feingold to win his election if we want =
to win a majority of seats in the Senate. As you know well, Paul Ryan is =
terrified of the prospect of losing the Senate.

Just imagine how much Paul Ryan doesn't want to see Senators Bernie =
Sanders and Russ Feingold working together.

You have already raised nearly $2.5 million to help candidates for the =
House and Senate since last week. Your contributions are completely =
changing races for Congress across the country.

Now we must focus our attention directly to support Russ Feingold. His =
race is critically important, and we need people to stand together to take =
on billionaires trying to buy this election.

Rush a $3 contribution directly to Russ Feingold's campaign so he can help =
take a majority in the Senate:

I've told you throughout this campaign, sisters and brothers, that no =
candidate for president, not Bernie Sanders, not the greatest president =
you could possibly imagine, can take on the billionaire class alone.

When I am elected president, I am going to need progressives in Congress =
who are willing to continue the fight we started in this campaign. Here =
are three:

Zephyr Teachout literally wrote the book on political corruption and is =
running for Congress in New York. Pramila Jayapal helped lead the fight =
for a $15 minimum wage and paid sick leave in Seattle, where she's now =
running for Congress. Lucy Flores is a progressive champion running for =
Congress in Nevada and one of the most courageous people I've met on the =
campaign. I need them with me in Washington, D.C., and that's why I have =
to ask:

Split a $2.70 contribution between Bernie 2016 and Lucy Flores, Zephyr =
Teachout, and Pramila Jayapal for Congress today and we are going to win =
this primary AND elect a Congress willing to stand up billionaire class of =
this country:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-need-progressives-in-congres=
s

Change almost never happens from the top down, it almost always occurs =
from the bottom up. I will do everything I can from the White House, but =
what this moment requires is people in the streets fighting for change, =
and electing a Congress that is willing to stand with them.

If we are able to successfully combine those three elements, nothing will =
be able to stop us. That is the political revolution.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

Dear Sisters and Brothers,

Today we are very proud to announce some extraordinary news: our =
supporters have made 2.5 million contributions to our campaign totaling =
$73 million, including $33 million in the last three months.


There were very few people in the world who would have believed you one =
year ago if you said that Bernie Sanders' supporters would raise $73 =
million by the end of the year for our presidential campaign. And yet here =
we are.

More important than how much money we've raised is how we have raised =
these funds. Incredibly, the vast majority of all the money we have raised =
comes from small-dollar contributions. You won&#39;t see that from our =
opponent. I don't go around asking a handful of millionaires and =
billionaires for big checks and call it a day.

The truth is our campaign finance system is nothing short of a national =
disgrace. Elections should be determined by the power of good ideas, not =
who can hustle the most money from the rich and powerful.

Real change comes when large numbers of Americans get involved in the =
democratic process. We have shown that is possible in terms of competing =
financially against the interests of the billionaire class. And now it is =
time to show that we can organize in our communities too.

With the first people voting for our next president in less than a month, =
we have an obligation right now to do all we can to bring as many people =
into the democratic process as we can. We have a real path toward victory =
if you can commit to talking to voters at local volunteer event in your =
community. Here's information for an event happening near you:

http://map.berniesanders.com/#zipcode=3D03223&amp;distance=3D50&amp;eventt=
ype=3DR&amp;eventtype=3DCW&amp;eventtype=3DO&amp;eventtype=3DD&amp;eventty=
pe=3DCV&amp;eventtype=3DB&amp;eventtype=3DRV&amp;eventtype=3DE&amp;dateran=
ge=3Dall-events&amp;sort=3Ddistance

Our supporters are organizing thousands more events in communities all =
across the country as well. You can find those here.

When we talk about a "political revolution," we are not just talking about =
tinkering around the edges of American society. We are talking about =
transforming our country in many respects -- the economy, health care, =
education, the environment, criminal justice, immigration and many other =
areas.

Powered by more than 2.5 million contributions from 1 million people =
donating less than $30 a piece, we have shown that our political =
revolution should not be underestimated.

I am excited to see what comes next. Thank you for all of your support.

In solidarity,

Bernie Sanders

This is unbelievable. In just 12 hours, you crushed our goal of raising =
$40 million in the month of February.

But I don't think we can stop now. Not so close to Super Tuesday. So in =
the spirit of this campaign, we're going to reach for a way bigger, way =
more difficult goal - raising $45 million this month.

I'll be honest: The math is extremely difficult here. Can we raise another =
$5 million today? Probably not. But I think it's very important that we =
try before tonight's midnight fundraising deadline.

Please, if you can, contribute $2.70 to our campaign and help us show the =
billionaire class the strength of our movement before midnight:

https://go.berniesanders.com/our-goal

We are doing something absolutely unprecedented together. Even if we don't =
reach the new goal of $45 million this month, know that trying for it is =
important. Let's get as close as we can.

Thank you for all you do for our campaign.

In solidarity,

Jeff Weaver
